 |      
 |              - All remaining properties are passed to the constructor of

 |      
 |              (e.g. [{&#39;type&#39;: &#39;scatter&#39;, ...}, {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;bar, ...}])
 |      
 |      layout
 |          The &#39;layout&#39; property is an instance of Layout
 |          that may be specified as:
 |            - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.Layout`
 |            - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
 |              to the Layout constructor
 |      
 |              Supported dict properties:
 |                  
 |                  activeshape
 |                      :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Activeshape
 |                      ` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |                  annotations
 |                      A tuple of
 |                      :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation`
 |                      instances or dicts with compatible properties
 |                  annotationdefaults
 |                      When used in a template (as
 |                      layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults),
 |                      sets the default property values to use for
 |                      elements of layout.annotations
 |                  autosize
 |                      Determines whether or not a layout width or
 |                      height that has been left undefined by the user
 |                      is initialized on each relayout. Note that,
 |                      regardless of this attribute, an undefined
 |                      layout width or height is always initialized on
 |                      the first call to plot.
 |                  autotypenumbers
 |                      Using &quot;strict&quot; a numeric string in trace data
 |                      is not converted to a number. Using *convert
 |                      types* a numeric string in trace data may be
 |                      treated as a number during automatic axis
 |                      `type` detection. This is the default value;
 |                      however it could be overridden for individual
 |                      axes.
 |                  bargap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      adjacent location coordinates.
 |                  bargroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      the same location coordinate.
 |                  barmode
 |                      Determines how bars at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. With
 |                      &quot;stack&quot;, the bars are stacked on top of one
 |                      another With &quot;relative&quot;, the bars are stacked
 |                      on top of one another, with negative values
 |                      below the axis, positive values above With
 |                      &quot;group&quot;, the bars are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location.
 |                      With &quot;overlay&quot;, the bars are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to an &quot;opacity&quot; to see
 |                      multiple bars.
 |                  barnorm
 |                      Sets the normalization for bar traces on the
 |                      graph. With &quot;fraction&quot;, the value of each bar
 |                      is divided by the sum of all values at that
 |                      location coordinate. &quot;percent&quot; is the same but
 |                      multiplied by 100 to show percentages.
 |                  boxgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect
 |                      on traces that have &quot;width&quot; set.
 |                  boxgroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of the same location coordinate. Has no effect
 |                      on traces that have &quot;width&quot; set.
 |                  boxmode
 |                      Determines how boxes at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. If
 |                      &quot;group&quot;, the boxes are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location. If
 |                      &quot;overlay&quot;, the boxes are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to set &quot;opacity&quot; to see
 |                      them multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces
 |                      that have &quot;width&quot; set.
 |                  calendar
 |                      Sets the default calendar system to use for
 |                      interpreting and displaying dates throughout
 |                      the plot.
 |                  clickmode
 |                      Determines the mode of single click
 |                      interactions. &quot;event&quot; is the default value and
 |                      emits the `plotly_click` event. In addition
 |                      this mode emits the `plotly_selected` event in
 |                      drag modes &quot;lasso&quot; and &quot;select&quot;, but with no
 |                      event data attached (kept for compatibility
 |                      reasons). The &quot;select&quot; flag enables selecting
 |                      single data points via click. This mode also
 |                      supports persistent selections, meaning that
 |                      pressing Shift while clicking, adds to /
 |                      subtracts from an existing selection. &quot;select&quot;
 |                      with `hovermode`: &quot;x&quot; can be confusing,
 |                      consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
 |                      &quot;closest&quot; when using this feature. Selection
 |                      events are sent accordingly as long as &quot;event&quot;
 |                      flag is set as well. When the &quot;event&quot; flag is
 |                      missing, `plotly_click` and `plotly_selected`
 |                      events are not fired.
 |                  coloraxis
 |                      :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis`
 |                      instance or dict with compatible properties

 |                      :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale`
 |                      instance or dict with compatible properties
 |                  colorway
 |                      Sets the default trace colors.
 |                  computed
 |                      Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting
 |                      values namely `margin.t`, `margin.b`,
 |                      `margin.l` and `margin.r` in &quot;full-json&quot; mode.
 |                  datarevision
 |                      If provided, a changed value tells
 |                      `Plotly.react` that one or more data arrays has
 |                      changed. This way you can modify arrays in-
 |                      place rather than making a complete new copy
 |                      for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
 |                      `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are
 |                      being treated as immutable, thus any data array
 |                      with a different identity from its predecessor
 |                      contains new data.
 |                  dragmode
 |                      Determines the mode of drag interactions.
 |                      &quot;select&quot; and &quot;lasso&quot; apply only to scatter
 |                      traces with markers or text. &quot;orbit&quot; and
 |                      &quot;turntable&quot; apply only to 3D scenes.
 |                  editrevision
 |                      Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
 |                      `editable: true` configuration, other than
 |                      trace names and axis titles. Defaults to
 |                      `layout.uirevision`.
 |                  extendfunnelareacolors
 |                      If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether
 |                      given by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from
 |                      `colorway`) will be extended to three times its
 |                      original length by first repeating every color
 |                      20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing
 |                      the same color when you have many slices, but
 |                      you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided
 |                      in the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never
 |                      extended.
 |                  extendiciclecolors
 |                      If `true`, the icicle slice colors (whether
 |                      given by `iciclecolorway` or inherited from
 |                      `colorway`) will be extended to three times its
 |                      original length by first repeating every color
 |                      20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing
 |                      the same color when you have many slices, but
 |                      you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided
 |                      in the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never
 |                      extended.
 |                  extendpiecolors
 |                      If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given
 |                      by `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
 |                      will be extended to three times its original
 |                      length by first repeating every color 20%
 |                      lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing

 |                  font
 |                      Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in
 |                      traces and other layout components inherit from

 |                  funnelareacolorway
 |                      Sets the default funnelarea slice colors.
 |                      Defaults to the main `colorway` used for trace
 |                      colors. If you specify a new list here it can
 |                      still be extended with lighter and darker
 |                      colors, see `extendfunnelareacolors`.
 |                  funnelgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of

 |                  funnelmode
 |                      Determines how bars at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. With
 |                      &quot;stack&quot;, the bars are stacked on top of one

 |                      to one another centered around the shared
 |                      location. With &quot;overlay&quot;, the bars are plotted
 |                      over one another, you might need to an

 |                  hoverdistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to add hover labels (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). This is
 |                      only a real distance for hovering on point-like
 |                      objects, like scatter points. For area-like
 |                      objects (bars, scatter fills, etc) hovering is
 |                      on inside the area and off outside, but these
 |                      objects will not supersede hover on point-like
 |                      objects in case of conflict.

 |                      :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`
 |                      instance or dict with compatible properties
 |                  hovermode
 |                      Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
 |                      &quot;closest&quot;, a single hoverlabel will appear for
 |                      the &quot;closest&quot; point within the `hoverdistance`.
 |                      If &quot;x&quot; (or &quot;y&quot;), multiple hoverlabels will
 |                      appear for multiple points at the &quot;closest&quot; x-
 |                      (or y-) coordinate within the `hoverdistance`,
 |                      with the caveat that no more than one
 |                      hoverlabel will appear per trace. If *x
 |                      unified* (or *y unified*), a single hoverlabel
 |                      will appear multiple points at the closest x-
 |                      (or y-) coordinate within the `hoverdistance`
 |                      with the caveat that no more than one
 |                      hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this mode,
 |                      spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular
 |                      to the specified axis. If false, hover
 |                      interactions are disabled.
 |                  iciclecolorway
 |                      Sets the default icicle slice colors. Defaults
 |                      to the main `colorway` used for trace colors.
 |                      If you specify a new list here it can still be

 |                  piecolorway
 |                      Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to

 |                      Determines whether or not a legend is drawn.
 |                      Default is `true` if there is a trace to show
 |                      and any of these: a) Two or more traces would
 |                      by default be shown in the legend. b) One pie
 |                      trace is shown in the legend. c) One trace is
 |                      explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
 |                  sliders
 |                      A tuple of

 |                  spikedistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to draw spikelines to (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). As with
 |                      hoverdistance, distance does not apply to area-
 |                      like objects. In addition, some objects can be
 |                      hovered on but will not generate spikelines,
 |                      such as scatter fills.
 |                  sunburstcolorway
 |                      Sets the default sunburst slice colors.
 |                      Defaults to the main `colorway` used for trace
 |                      colors. If you specify a new list here it can
 |                      still be extended with lighter and darker
 |                      colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
 |                  template
 |                      Default attributes to be applied to the plot.
 |                      This should be a dict with format: `{&#39;layout&#39;:
 |                      layoutTemplate, &#39;data&#39;: {trace_type:
 |                      [traceTemplate, ...], ...}}` where
 |                      `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching the
 |                      structure of `figure.layout` and
 |                      `traceTemplate` is a dict matching the
 |                      structure of the trace with type `trace_type`
 |                      (e.g. &#39;scatter&#39;). Alternatively, this may be
 |                      specified as an instance of
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace
 |                      templates are applied cyclically to traces of
 |                      each type. Container arrays (eg `annotations`)
 |                      have special handling: An object ending in
 |                      `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`) is applied
 |                      to each array item. But if an item has a
 |                      `templateitemname` key we look in the template
 |                      array for an item with matching `name` and
 |                      apply that instead. If no matching `name` is
 |                      found we mark the item invisible. Any named
 |                      template item not referenced is appended to the
 |                      end of the array, so this can be used to add a
 |                      watermark annotation or a logo image, for
 |                      example. To omit one of these items on the
 |                      plot, make an item with matching
 |                      `templateitemname` and `visible: false`.

 |                      title&#39;s font used to be customized by the now
 |                      deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
 |                  transition
 |                      Sets transition options used during
 |                      Plotly.react updates.
 |                  treemapcolorway
 |                      Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults
 |                      to the main `colorway` used for trace colors.
 |                      If you specify a new list here it can still be
 |                      extended with lighter and darker colors, see
 |                      `extendtreemapcolors`.
 |                  uirevision
 |                      Used to allow user interactions with the plot
 |                      to persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are
 |                      unaware of these interactions. If `uirevision`
 |                      is omitted, or if it is given and it changed
 |                      from the previous `Plotly.react` call, the
 |                      exact new figure is used. If `uirevision` is
 |                      truthy and did NOT change, any attribute that
 |                      has been affected by user interactions and did
 |                      not receive a different value in the new figure
 |                      will keep the interaction value.
 |                      `layout.uirevision` attribute serves as the
 |                      default for `uirevision` attributes in various
 |                      sub-containers. For finer control you can set
 |                      these sub-attributes directly. For example, if
 |                      your app separately controls the data on the x
 |                      and y axes you might set
 |                      `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
 |                      `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y
 |                      data is changed, you can update
 |                      `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*` and the y axis
 |                      range will reset but the x axis range will
 |                      retain any user-driven zoom.

 |      frames
 |          The &#39;frames&#39; property is a tuple of instances of
 |          Frame that may be specified as:
 |            - A list or tuple of instances of plotly.graph_objs.Frame
 |            - A list or tuple of dicts of string/value properties that
 |              will be passed to the Frame constructor
 |      
 |              Supported dict properties:
 |                  
 |                  baseframe
 |                      The name of the frame into which this frame&#39;s
 |                      properties are merged before applying. This is
 |                      used to unify properties and avoid needing to
 |                      specify the same values for the same properties
 |                      in multiple frames.
 |                  data
 |                      A list of traces this frame modifies. The
 |                      format is identical to the normal trace
 |                      definition.
 |                  group
 |                      An identifier that specifies the group to which
 |                      the frame belongs, used by animate to select a
 |                      subset of frames.
 |                  layout
 |                      Layout properties which this frame modifies.
 |                      The format is identical to the normal layout
 |                      definition.
 |                  name
 |                      A label by which to identify the frame
 |                  traces
 |                      A list of trace indices that identify the

 |      
 |      skip_invalid: bool
 |          If True, invalid properties in the figure specification will be

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arg
 |          instance of Annotation or dict with compatible
 |          properties
 |      align
 |          Sets the horizontal alignment of the `text` within the
 |          box. Has an effect only if `text` spans two or more
 |          lines (i.e. `text` contains one or more &lt;br&gt; HTML tags)
 |          or if an explicit width is set to override the text
 |          width.
 |      arrowcolor
 |          Sets the color of the annotation arrow.
 |      arrowhead
 |          Sets the end annotation arrow head style.
 |      arrowside
 |          Sets the annotation arrow head position.
 |      arrowsize
 |          Sets the size of the end annotation arrow head,
 |          relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1 (default) gives
 |          a head about 3x as wide as the line.
 |      arrowwidth
 |          Sets the width (in px) of annotation arrow line.
 |      ax
 |          Sets the x component of the arrow tail about the arrow
 |          head. If `axref` is `pixel`, a positive (negative)
 |          component corresponds to an arrow pointing from right
 |          to left (left to right). If `axref` is not `pixel` and
 |          is exactly the same as `xref`, this is an absolute
 |          value on that axis, like `x`, specified in the same
 |          coordinates as `xref`.
 |      axref
 |          Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the
 |          annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a ax axis id
 |          (e.g. &quot;ax&quot; or &quot;ax2&quot;), the `ax` position refers to a ax
 |          coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `ax` position refers
 |          to the distance from the left of the plotting area in
 |          normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
 |          left (right). If set to a ax axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the left of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *ax2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second ax  axis and a ax position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the left and the right of
 |          the domain of the second ax axis. In order for absolute
 |          positioning of the arrow to work, &quot;axref&quot; must be
 |          exactly the same as &quot;xref&quot;, otherwise &quot;axref&quot; will
 |          revert to &quot;pixel&quot; (explained next). For relative
 |          positioning, &quot;axref&quot; can be set to &quot;pixel&quot;, in which
 |          case the &quot;ax&quot; value is specified in pixels relative to
 |          &quot;x&quot;. Absolute positioning is useful for trendline
 |          annotations which should continue to indicate the
 |          correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is
 |          useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated
 |          point.
 |      ay
 |          Sets the y component of the arrow tail about the arrow
 |          head. If `ayref` is `pixel`, a positive (negative)
 |          component corresponds to an arrow pointing from bottom
 |          to top (top to bottom). If `ayref` is not `pixel` and
 |          is exactly the same as `yref`, this is an absolute
 |          value on that axis, like `y`, specified in the same
 |          coordinates as `yref`.
 |      ayref
 |          Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the
 |          annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a ay axis id
 |          (e.g. &quot;ay&quot; or &quot;ay2&quot;), the `ay` position refers to a ay
 |          coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `ay` position refers
 |          to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in
 |          normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
 |          bottom (top). If set to a ay axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *ay2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second ay  axis and a ay position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the bottom and the top of
 |          the domain of the second ay axis. In order for absolute
 |          positioning of the arrow to work, &quot;ayref&quot; must be
 |          exactly the same as &quot;yref&quot;, otherwise &quot;ayref&quot; will
 |          revert to &quot;pixel&quot; (explained next). For relative
 |          positioning, &quot;ayref&quot; can be set to &quot;pixel&quot;, in which
 |          case the &quot;ay&quot; value is specified in pixels relative to
 |          &quot;y&quot;. Absolute positioning is useful for trendline
 |          annotations which should continue to indicate the
 |          correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is
 |          useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated
 |          point.
 |      bgcolor
 |          Sets the background color of the annotation.
 |      bordercolor
 |          Sets the color of the border enclosing the annotation
 |          `text`.
 |      borderpad
 |          Sets the padding (in px) between the `text` and the
 |          enclosing border.
 |      borderwidth
 |          Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the
 |          annotation `text`.
 |      captureevents
 |          Determines whether the annotation text box captures
 |          mouse move and click events, or allows those events to
 |          pass through to data points in the plot that may be
 |          behind the annotation. By default `captureevents` is
 |          False unless `hovertext` is provided. If you use the
 |          event `plotly_clickannotation` without `hovertext` you
 |          must explicitly enable `captureevents`.
 |      clicktoshow
 |          Makes this annotation respond to clicks on the plot. If
 |          you click a data point that exactly matches the `x` and
 |          `y` values of this annotation, and it is hidden
 |          (visible: false), it will appear. In &quot;onoff&quot; mode, you
 |          must click the same point again to make it disappear,
 |          so if you click multiple points, you can show multiple
 |          annotations. In &quot;onout&quot; mode, a click anywhere else in
 |          the plot (on another data point or not) will hide this
 |          annotation. If you need to show/hide this annotation in
 |          response to different `x` or `y` values, you can set
 |          `xclick` and/or `yclick`. This is useful for example to
 |          label the side of a bar. To label markers though,
 |          `standoff` is preferred over `xclick` and `yclick`.
 |      font
 |          Sets the annotation text font.
 |      height
 |          Sets an explicit height for the text box. null
 |          (default) lets the text set the box height. Taller text
 |          will be clipped.
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.annotation.Hoverlab
 |          el` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets text to appear when hovering over this annotation.
 |          If omitted or blank, no hover label will appear.
 |      name
 |          When used in a template, named items are created in the
 |          output figure in addition to any items the figure
 |          already has in this array. You can modify these items
 |          in the output figure by making your own item with
 |          `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your
 |          modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
 |          false` to hide it). Has no effect outside of a
 |          template.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the annotation (text + arrow).
 |      showarrow
 |          Determines whether or not the annotation is drawn with
 |          an arrow. If True, `text` is placed near the arrow&#39;s
 |          tail. If False, `text` lines up with the `x` and `y`
 |          provided.
 |      standoff
 |          Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end arrowhead
 |          away from the position it is pointing at, for example
 |          to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom.
 |          Note that this shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay`
 |          vector, in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves
 |          everything by this amount.
 |      startarrowhead
 |          Sets the start annotation arrow head style.
 |      startarrowsize
 |          Sets the size of the start annotation arrow head,
 |          relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1 (default) gives
 |          a head about 3x as wide as the line.
 |      startstandoff
 |          Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the start arrowhead
 |          away from the position it is pointing at, for example
 |          to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom.
 |          Note that this shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay`
 |          vector, in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves
 |          everything by this amount.
 |      templateitemname
 |          Used to refer to a named item in this array in the
 |          template. Named items from the template will be created
 |          even without a matching item in the input figure, but
 |          you can modify one by making an item with
 |          `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your
 |          modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
 |          false` to hide it). If there is no template or no
 |          matching item, this item will be hidden unless you
 |          explicitly show it with `visible: true`.
 |      text
 |          Sets the text associated with this annotation. Plotly
 |          uses a subset of HTML tags to do things like newline
 |          (&lt;br&gt;), bold (&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;), italics (&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), hyperlinks
 |          (&lt;a href=&#39;...&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Tags &lt;em&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;, &lt;sub&gt; &lt;span&gt;
 |          are also supported.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle at which the `text` is drawn with
 |          respect to the horizontal.
 |      valign
 |          Sets the vertical alignment of the `text` within the
 |          box. Has an effect only if an explicit height is set to
 |          override the text height.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this annotation is visible.
 |      width
 |          Sets an explicit width for the text box. null (default)
 |          lets the text set the box width. Wider text will be
 |          clipped. There is no automatic wrapping; use &lt;br&gt; to
 |          start a new line.
 |      x
 |          Sets the annotation&#39;s x position. If the axis `type` is
 |          &quot;log&quot;, then you must take the log of your desired
 |          range. If the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;, it should be date
 |          strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix
 |          milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings.
 |          If the axis `type` is &quot;category&quot;, it should be numbers,
 |          using the scale where each category is assigned a
 |          serial number from zero in the order it appears.
 |      xanchor
 |          Sets the text box&#39;s horizontal position anchor This
 |          anchor binds the `x` position to the &quot;left&quot;, &quot;center&quot;
 |          or &quot;right&quot; of the annotation. For example, if `x` is
 |          set to 1, `xref` to &quot;paper&quot; and `xanchor` to &quot;right&quot;
 |          then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up
 |          with the right-most edge of the plotting area. If
 |          &quot;auto&quot;, the anchor is equivalent to &quot;center&quot; for data-
 |          referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas
 |          for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked
 |          corresponds to the closest side.
 |      xclick
 |          Toggle this annotation when clicking a data point whose
 |          `x` value is `xclick` rather than the annotation&#39;s `x`
 |          value.
 |      xref
 |          Sets the annotation&#39;s x coordinate axis. If set to a x
 |          axis id (e.g. &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x2&quot;), the `x` position refers to
 |          a x coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `x` position
 |          refers to the distance from the left of the plotting
 |          area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds
 |          to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the left of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second x  axis and a x position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the left and the right of
 |          the domain of the second x axis.
 |      xshift
 |          Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow
 |          to the right (positive) or left (negative) by this many
 |          pixels.
 |      y
 |          Sets the annotation&#39;s y position. If the axis `type` is
 |          &quot;log&quot;, then you must take the log of your desired
 |          range. If the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;, it should be date
 |          strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix
 |          milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings.
 |          If the axis `type` is &quot;category&quot;, it should be numbers,
 |          using the scale where each category is assigned a
 |          serial number from zero in the order it appears.
 |      yanchor
 |          Sets the text box&#39;s vertical position anchor This
 |          anchor binds the `y` position to the &quot;top&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; or
 |          &quot;bottom&quot; of the annotation. For example, if `y` is set
 |          to 1, `yref` to &quot;paper&quot; and `yanchor` to &quot;top&quot; then the
 |          top-most portion of the annotation lines up with the
 |          top-most edge of the plotting area. If &quot;auto&quot;, the
 |          anchor is equivalent to &quot;middle&quot; for data-referenced
 |          annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-
 |          referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds
 |          to the closest side.
 |      yclick
 |          Toggle this annotation when clicking a data point whose
 |          `y` value is `yclick` rather than the annotation&#39;s `y`
 |          value.
 |      yref
 |          Sets the annotation&#39;s y coordinate axis. If set to a y
 |          axis id (e.g. &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y2&quot;), the `y` position refers to
 |          a y coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `y` position
 |          refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting
 |          area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds
 |          to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second y  axis and a y position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the bottom and the top of
 |          the domain of the second y axis.
 |      yshift
 |          Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow
 |          up (positive) or down (negative) by this many pixels.
 |      row
 |          Subplot row for annotation. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col
 |          Subplot column for annotation. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y
 |          Whether to add annotation to secondary y-axis
 |      exclude_empty_subplots
 |          If True, annotation will not be added to subplots
 |          without traces.

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      base
 |          Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
 |          units). In &quot;stack&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; barmode, traces that
 |          set &quot;base&quot; will be excluded and drawn in &quot;overlay&quot; mode
 |          instead.
 |      basesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          base .
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
 |          subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
 |          and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
 |          `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
 |      constraintext
 |          Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
 |          be no larger than the bar itself.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.

 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Hoverlabel` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variables `value` and `label`. Anything
 |          contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the
 |          secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      insidetextanchor
 |          Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
 |          points in `textposition` &quot;inside&quot; mode.
 |      insidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Marker` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
 |          axis units). In &quot;group&quot; barmode, traces that set
 |          &quot;offset&quot; will be excluded and drawn in &quot;overlay&quot; mode
 |          instead.
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      offsetsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          offset .
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the bars. With &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;), the
 |          value of the each bar spans along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Selected` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
 |          bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
 |          labels vertically. With &quot;auto&quot; the texts may
 |          automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
 |          in bars.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &quot;inside&quot;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &quot;outside&quot; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &quot;auto&quot; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
 |          &quot;none&quot;, no text appears.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          textposition .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `value` and
 |          `label`.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
 |      widthsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          width .
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          alignment of data points on the x axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-

 |      yperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the y
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be

 |      Add a new Barpolar trace
 |      
 |      The data visualized by the radial span of the bars is set in
 |      `r`
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      base
 |          Sets where the bar base is drawn (in radial axis
 |          units). In &quot;stack&quot; barmode, traces that set &quot;base&quot; will
 |          be excluded and drawn in &quot;overlay&quot; mode instead.
 |      basesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          base .
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Marker` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the angular position where the bar is drawn (in
 |          &quot;thetatunit&quot; units).
 |      offsetsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          offset .

 |      r
 |          Sets the radial coordinates
 |      r0
 |          Alternate to `r`. Builds a linear space of r
 |          coordinates. Use with `dr` where `r0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dr` the step.
 |      rsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  r
 |          .
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Selected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a polar subplot. If &quot;polar&quot; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.polar`. If &quot;polar2&quot;, the data
 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
 |          single string, the same string appears over all bars.
 |          If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to
 |          the this trace&#39;s coordinates.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      theta
 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &quot;theta&quot; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &quot;linear&quot; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar angular width (in &quot;thetaunit&quot; units).
 |      widthsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          width .
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all

 |      Add a new Box trace
 |      
 |      Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The
 |      second quartile (Q2, i.e. the median) is marked by a line
 |      inside the box. The fences grow outward from the boxes&#39; edges,
 |      by default they span +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range
 |      (IQR: Q3-Q1), The sample mean and standard deviation as well as
 |      notches and the sample, outlier and suspected outliers points
 |      can be optionally added to the box plot. The values and
 |      positions corresponding to each boxes can be input using two
 |      signatures. The first signature expects users to supply the
 |      sample values in the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for
 |      horizontal boxes). By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one box per
 |      distinct `x` (`y`) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) list is
 |      provided, a single box is drawn. In this case, the box is
 |      positioned with the trace `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if
 |      provided. The second signature expects users to supply the
 |      boxes corresponding Q1, median and Q3 statistics in the `q1`,
 |      `median` and `q3` data arrays respectively. Other box features
 |      relying on statistics namely `lowerfence`, `upperfence`,
 |      `notchspan` can be set directly by the users. To have plotly
 |      compute them or to show sample points besides the boxes, users
 |      can set the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for
 |      horizontal boxes) to a 2D array with the outer length
 |      corresponding to the number of boxes in the traces and the
 |      inner length corresponding the sample size.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      boxmean
 |          If True, the mean of the box(es)&#39; underlying
 |          distribution is drawn as a dashed line inside the
 |          box(es). If &quot;sd&quot; the standard deviation is also drawn.
 |          Defaults to True when `mean` is set. Defaults to &quot;sd&quot;
 |          when `sd` is set Otherwise defaults to False.
 |      boxpoints
 |          If &quot;outliers&quot;, only the sample points lying outside the
 |          whiskers are shown If &quot;suspectedoutliers&quot;, the outlier
 |          points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3
 |          or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
 |          `outliercolor`) If &quot;all&quot;, all sample points are shown
 |          If False, only the box(es) are shown with no sample
 |          points Defaults to &quot;suspectedoutliers&quot; when
 |          `marker.outliercolor` or `marker.line.outliercolor` is
 |          set. Defaults to &quot;all&quot; under the q1/median/q3
 |          signature. Otherwise defaults to &quot;outliers&quot;.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dx

 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          sample points or both?
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      jitter
 |          Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.
 |          If 0, the sample points align along the distribution
 |          axis. If 1, the sample points are drawn in a random
 |          jitter of width equal to the width of the box(es).
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      line
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Line` instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      lowerfence
 |          Sets the lower fence values. There should be as many
 |          items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute
 |          has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If
 |          `lowerfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or
 |          `x`) is set, we compute the lower as the last sample
 |          point below 1.5 times the IQR.
 |      lowerfencesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          lowerfence .
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Marker` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      mean
 |          Sets the mean values. There should be as many items as
 |          the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect
 |          only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If `mean` is not
 |          provided but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we
 |          compute the mean for each box using the sample values.
 |      meansrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          mean .
 |      median
 |          Sets the median values. There should be as many items
 |          as the number of boxes desired.
 |      mediansrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          median .
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover. For box traces, the name will
 |          also be used for the position coordinate, if `x` and
 |          `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and the
 |          position axis is categorical
 |      notched
 |          Determines whether or not notches are drawn. Notches
 |          displays a confidence interval around the median. We
 |          compute the confidence interval as median +/- 1.57 *
 |          IQR / sqrt(N), where IQR is the interquartile range and
 |          N is the sample size. If two boxes&#39; notches do not
 |          overlap there is 95% confidence their medians differ.
 |          See https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home
 |          /notched-box-plots for more info. Defaults to False
 |          unless `notchwidth` or `notchspan` is set.
 |      notchspan
 |          Sets the notch span from the boxes&#39; `median` values.
 |          There should be as many items as the number of boxes
 |          desired. This attribute has effect only under the
 |          q1/median/q3 signature. If `notchspan` is not provided
 |          but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we compute it as
 |          1.57 * IQR / sqrt(N), where N is the sample size.
 |      notchspansrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          notchspan .
 |      notchwidth
 |          Sets the width of the notches relative to the box&#39;
 |          width. For example, with 0, the notches are as wide as
 |          the box(es).
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the box(es). If &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;), the
 |          distribution is visualized along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      pointpos
 |          Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
 |          the box(es). If 0, the sample points are places over
 |          the center of the box(es). Positive (negative) values
 |          correspond to positions to the right (left) for
 |          vertical boxes and above (below) for horizontal boxes
 |      q1
 |          Sets the Quartile 1 values. There should be as many
 |          items as the number of boxes desired.
 |      q1src
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  q1
 |          .
 |      q3
 |          Sets the Quartile 3 values. There should be as many
 |          items as the number of boxes desired.
 |      q3src
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  q3
 |          .
 |      quartilemethod
 |          Sets the method used to compute the sample&#39;s Q1 and Q3
 |          quartiles. The &quot;linear&quot; method uses the 25th percentile
 |          for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using
 |          method #10 (listed on http://www.amstat.org/publication
 |          s/jse/v14n3/langford.html). The &quot;exclusive&quot; method uses
 |          the median to divide the ordered dataset into two
 |          halves if the sample is odd, it does not include the
 |          median in either half - Q1 is then the median of the
 |          lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half. The
 |          &quot;inclusive&quot; method also uses the median to divide the
 |          ordered dataset into two halves but if the sample is
 |          odd, it includes the median in both halves - Q1 is then
 |          the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the
 |          upper half.
 |      sd
 |          Sets the standard deviation values. There should be as
 |          many items as the number of boxes desired. This
 |          attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3
 |          signature. If `sd` is not provided but a sample (in `y`
 |          or `x`) is set, we compute the standard deviation for
 |          each box using the sample values.
 |      sdsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  sd
 |          .
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Selected` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each sample
 |          value. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Unselected` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      upperfence
 |          Sets the upper fence values. There should be as many
 |          items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute
 |          has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If
 |          `upperfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or
 |          `x`) is set, we compute the lower as the last sample
 |          point above 1.5 times the IQR.
 |      upperfencesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          upperfence .
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      whiskerwidth
 |          Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box&#39;
 |          width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as
 |          the box(es).
 |      width
 |          Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0
 |          (default value) the width is automatically selected
 |          based on the positions of other box traces in the same
 |          subplot.
 |      x
 |          Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.
 |      x0
 |          Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the
 |          starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
 |          q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:

 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc

 |          Sets the open values.
 |      opensrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          open .
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.candlestick.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each sample
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to this trace&#39;s sample points.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      whiskerwidth
 |          Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box&#39;
 |          width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as
 |          the box(es).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates. If absent, linear coordinate
 |          will be generated.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:

 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a

 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.

 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      meta

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet
 |          point. If omitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the
 |          xaxis is hidden by default.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      y
 |          A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
 |          point.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  y
 |          .
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:

 |      Add a new Choropleth trace
 |      
 |      The data that describes the choropleth value-to-color mapping
 |      is set in `z`. The geographic locations corresponding to each
 |      value in `z` are set in `locations`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.ColorBar`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata

 |      geo
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s geospatial
 |          coordinates and a geographic map. If &quot;geo&quot; (the default
 |          value), the geospatial coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.geo`. If &quot;geo2&quot;, the geospatial coordinates
 |          refer to `layout.geo2`, and so on.
 |      geojson
 |          Sets optional GeoJSON data associated with this trace.
 |          If not given, the features on the base map are used. It
 |          can be set as a valid GeoJSON object or as a URL
 |          string. Note that we only accept GeoJSONs of type
 |          &quot;FeatureCollection&quot; or &quot;Feature&quot; with geometries of
 |          type &quot;Polygon&quot; or &quot;MultiPolygon&quot;.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as

 |      Add a new Choroplethmapbox trace
 |      
 |      GeoJSON features to be filled are set in `geojson` The data
 |      that describes the choropleth value-to-color mapping is set in
 |      `locations` and `z`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      below
 |          Determines if the choropleth polygons will be inserted
 |          before the layer with the specified ID. By default,
 |          choroplethmapbox traces are placed above the water
 |          layers. If set to &#39;&#39;, the layer will be inserted above
 |          every existing layer.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choroplethmapbox.ColorBar`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |      geojson
 |          Sets the GeoJSON data associated with this trace. It
 |          can be set as a valid GeoJSON object or as a URL
 |          string. Note that we only accept GeoJSONs of type
 |          &quot;FeatureCollection&quot; or &quot;Feature&quot; with geometries of
 |          type &quot;Polygon&quot; or &quot;MultiPolygon&quot;.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          are available. variable `properties` Anything contained
 |          in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .

 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      locations

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .

 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choroplethmapbox.Selected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choroplethmapbox.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a mapbox subplot. If &quot;mapbox&quot; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.mapbox`. If &quot;mapbox2&quot;, the
 |          data refer to `layout.mapbox2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each location.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choroplethmapbox.Unselecte
 |          d` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      z
 |          Sets the color values.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax

 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.cone.Hoverlabel` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variable `norm` Anything contained in
 |          tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.cone.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      lighting
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.cone.Lighting` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      lightposition
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.cone.Lightposition`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      sizemode
 |          Determines whether `sizeref` is set as a &quot;scaled&quot; (i.e
 |          unitless) scalar (normalized by the max u/v/w norm in
 |          the vector field) or as &quot;absolute&quot; value (in the same
 |          units as the vector field).
 |      sizeref
 |          Adjusts the cone size scaling. The size of the cones is
 |          determined by their u/v/w norm multiplied a factor and
 |          `sizeref`. This factor (computed internally)
 |          corresponds to the minimum &quot;time&quot; to travel across two
 |          successive x/y/z positions at the average velocity of
 |          those two successive positions. All cones in a given
 |          trace use the same factor. With `sizemode` set to
 |          &quot;scaled&quot;, `sizeref` is unitless, its default value is
 |          0.5 With `sizemode` set to &quot;absolute&quot;, `sizeref` has
 |          the same units as the u/v/w vector field, its the
 |          default value is half the sample&#39;s maximum vector norm.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.cone.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the cones. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      u
 |          Sets the x components of the vector field.
 |      uhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `u`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format.By
 |          default the values are formatted using generic number
 |          format.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |      Add a new Contour trace
 |      
 |      The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`.
 |      Data in `z` must be a 2D list of numbers. Say that `z` has N
 |      rows and M columns, then by default, these N rows correspond to
 |      N y coordinates (set in `y` or auto-generated) and the M
 |      columns correspond to M x coordinates (set in `x` or auto-
 |      generated). By setting `transpose` to True, the above behavior
 |      is flipped.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of
 |          contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If False, set
 |          the contour level attributes in `contours`.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contour.ColorBar` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the `z` data are filled in. It is defaulted
 |          to true if `z` is a one dimensional array otherwise it
 |          is defaulted to false.
 |      contours
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contour.Contours` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements

 |          available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed

 |          with them.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables

 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      line

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contour.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with

 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment

 |          and &quot;dx&quot; (the default behavior when `x` is not
 |          provided).
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.

 |          provided)
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      a
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      a0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x

 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  a
 |          .
 |      atype
 |          If &quot;array&quot;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by

 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of

 |          trace lies
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name

 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements

 |          itle` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on

 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      line
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contourcarpet.Line`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contourcarpet.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  z
 |          .

 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These

 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      below
 |          Determines if the densitymapbox trace will be inserted
 |          before the layer with the specified ID. By default,
 |          densitymapbox traces are placed below the first layer
 |          of type symbol If set to &#39;&#39;, the layer will be inserted
 |          above every existing layer.

 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.densitymapbox.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a mapbox subplot. If &quot;mapbox&quot; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.mapbox`. If &quot;mapbox2&quot;, the
 |          data refer to `layout.mapbox2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair
 |          If a single string, the same string appears over all
 |          the data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (lon,lat)
 |          coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot;
 |          flag and &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be
 |          seen in the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      z
 |          Sets the points&#39; weight. For example, a value of 10
 |          would be equivalent to having 10 points of weight 1 in
 |          the same spot
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  z
 |          .
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).

 |      Add a new Funnel trace
 |      
 |      Visualize stages in a process using length-encoded bars. This
 |      trace can be used to show data in either a part-to-whole
 |      representation wherein each item appears in a single stage, or
 |      in a &quot;drop-off&quot; representation wherein each item appears in
 |      each stage it traversed. See also the &quot;funnelarea&quot; trace type
 |      for a different approach to visualizing funnel data.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
 |          subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
 |          and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
 |          `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
 |      connector
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnel.Connector` instance

 |          be no larger than the bar itself.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnel.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variables `percentInitial`,
 |          `percentPrevious` and `percentTotal`. Anything
 |          contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the
 |          secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      insidetextanchor
 |          Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
 |          points in `textposition` &quot;inside&quot; mode.
 |      insidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnel.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnel.Marker` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
 |          axis units). In &quot;group&quot; barmode, traces that set
 |          &quot;offset&quot; will be excluded and drawn in &quot;overlay&quot; mode
 |          instead.
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the funnels. With &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;),
 |          the value of the each bar spans along the vertical
 |          (horizontal). By default funnels are tend to be
 |          oriented horizontally; unless only &quot;y&quot; array is
 |          presented or orientation is set to &quot;v&quot;. Also regarding
 |          graphs including only &#39;horizontal&#39; funnels, &quot;autorange&quot;
 |          on the &quot;y-axis&quot; are set to &quot;reversed&quot;.
 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnel.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
 |          bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
 |          labels vertically. With &quot;auto&quot; the texts may
 |          automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
 |          in bars.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
 |          In the case of having multiple funnels, percentages &amp;
 |          totals are computed separately (per trace).
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &quot;inside&quot;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &quot;outside&quot; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &quot;auto&quot; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
 |          &quot;none&quot;, no text appears.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          textposition .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables
 |          `percentInitial`, `percentPrevious`, `percentTotal`,
 |          `label` and `value`.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:

 |          and `dlabel` the step.
 |      labels
 |          Sets the sector labels. If `labels` entries are
 |          duplicated, we sum associated `values` or simply count
 |          occurrences if `values` is not provided. For other
 |          array attributes (including color) we use the first

 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnelarea.Marker`

 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using

 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      values
 |          Sets the values of the sectors. If omitted, we count
 |          occurrences of each label.
 |      valuessrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      Add a new Heatmap trace
 |      
 |      The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is
 |      set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a 2D list of values
 |      (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z`
 |      is a 2D list, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by
 |      default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the
 |      y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the
 |      i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th
 |      partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot)
 |      and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of
 |      the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`.
 |      Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1)
 |      elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the
 |      center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If
 |      M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the
 |      heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D list, the x and y
 |      coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to
 |      form data triplets.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.ColorBar` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the `z` data are filled in. It is defaulted
 |          to true if `z` is a one dimensional array and `zsmooth`
 |          is not false; otherwise it is defaulted to false.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements

 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |      hoverongaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the `z` data have hover labels associated
 |          with them.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xgap
 |          Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to

 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By

 |      xperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          alignment of data points on the x axis.

 |          &quot;scaled&quot;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by &quot;x0&quot;
 |          and &quot;dx&quot; (the default behavior when `x` is not
 |          provided).
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      ygap
 |          Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.

 |          and &quot;dy&quot; (the default behavior when `y` is not
 |          provided)
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `z`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to

 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling

 |      Add a new Heatmapgl trace
 |      
 |      &quot;heatmapgl&quot; trace is deprecated! Please consider switching to
 |      the &quot;heatmap&quot; or &quot;image&quot; trace types. Alternatively you could
 |      contribute/sponsor rewriting this trace type based on cartesian
 |      features and using regl framework. WebGL version of the heatmap
 |      trace type.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmapgl.ColorBar`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmapgl.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmapgl.Legendgrouptitle
 |          ` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmapgl.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      xtype
 |          If &quot;array&quot;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by
 |          &quot;x&quot; (the default behavior when `x` is provided). If
 |          &quot;scaled&quot;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by &quot;x0&quot;
 |          and &quot;dx&quot; (the default behavior when `x` is not
 |          provided).
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  y
 |          .
 |      ytype
 |          If &quot;array&quot;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by
 |          &quot;y&quot; (the default behavior when `y` is provided) If
 |          &quot;scaled&quot;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by &quot;y0&quot;
 |          and &quot;dy&quot; (the default behavior when `y` is not
 |          provided)
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zsmooth
 |          Picks a smoothing algorithm use to smooth `z` data.
 |      zsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  z
 |          .
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.

 |      Add a new Histogram trace
 |      
 |      The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in
 |      `x` for vertically spanning histograms and in `y` for
 |      horizontally spanning histograms. Binning options are set
 |      `xbins` and `ybins` respectively if no aggregation data is
 |      provided.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      bingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have
 |          compatible bin settings. Note that traces on the same
 |          subplot and with the same &quot;orientation&quot; under `barmode`
 |          &quot;stack&quot;, &quot;relative&quot; and &quot;group&quot; are forced into the
 |          same bingroup, Using `bingroup`, traces under `barmode`
 |          &quot;overlay&quot; and on different axes (of the same axis type)
 |          can have compatible bin settings. Note that histogram
 |          and histogram2d* trace can share the same `bingroup`
 |      cumulative
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Cumulative`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      error_x
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.ErrorX` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.ErrorY` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &quot;count&quot;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &quot;&quot;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &quot;percent&quot; / &quot;probability&quot;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &quot;density&quot;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.

 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variable `binNumber` Anything contained
 |          in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Legendgrouptitle
 |          ` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Marker` instance

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      nbinsx
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the

 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the bars. With &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;), the
 |          value of the each bar spans along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Selected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
 |          single string, the same string appears over all bars.
 |          If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to
 |          the this trace&#39;s coordinates.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

 |      Add a new Histogram2d trace
 |      
 |      The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in
 |      `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal
 |      distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this
 |      case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and
 |      binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The
 |      resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      bingroup
 |          Set the `xbingroup` and `ybingroup` default prefix For
 |          example, setting a `bingroup` of 1 on two histogram2d
 |          traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match
 |          separately.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2d.ColorBar`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &quot;count&quot;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &quot;&quot;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &quot;percent&quot; / &quot;probability&quot;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &quot;density&quot;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2d.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.

 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variable `z` Anything contained in tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      ids

 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.

 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      nbinsx
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `ybins.size` is provided.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2d.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
 |      xaxis

 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have

 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x

 |      y
 |          Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have
 |          compatible y-bin settings. Using `ybingroup`,
 |          histogram2d and histogram2dcontour traces  (on axes of
 |          the same axis type) can have compatible y-bin settings.
 |          Note that the same `ybingroup` value can be used to set
 |          (1D) histogram `bingroup`
 |      ybins

 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  y
 |          .
 |      z
 |          Sets the aggregation data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the

 |          default the values are formatted using generic number
 |          format.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no

 |      Add a new Histogram2dContour trace
 |      
 |      The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in
 |      `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal
 |      distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this
 |      case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and
 |      binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The
 |      resulting distribution is visualized as a contour plot.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of
 |          contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If False, set
 |          the contour level attributes in `contours`.
 |      bingroup
 |          Set the `xbingroup` and `ybingroup` default prefix For
 |          example, setting a `bingroup` of 1 on two histogram2d
 |          traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match
 |          separately.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.ColorBa
 |          r` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      contours
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Contour
 |          s` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &quot;count&quot;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &quot;&quot;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &quot;percent&quot; / &quot;probability&quot;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &quot;density&quot;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Hoverla
 |          bel` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variable `z` Anything contained in tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object

 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      nbinsx
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `ybins.size` is provided.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have

 |          .
 |      z
 |          Sets the aggregation data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      branchvalues

 |          set to &quot;total&quot;, items in `values` are taken to be value
 |          of all its descendants. When set to &quot;remainder&quot;, items
 |          in `values` corresponding to the root and the branches
 |          sectors are taken to be the extra part not part of the
 |          sum of the values at their leaves.
 |      count
 |          Determines default for `values` when it is not
 |          provided, by inferring a 1 for each of the &quot;leaves&quot;
 |          and/or &quot;branches&quot;, otherwise 0.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variables `currentPath`, `root`,
 |          `entry`, `percentRoot`, `percentEntry` and
 |          `percentParent`. Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |          If a single string, the same string appears for all
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order of this trace&#39;s sectors. To be seen,
 |          trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids

 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      level
 |          Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is
 |          rendered. Set `level` to `&#39;&#39;` to start from the root
 |          node in the hierarchy. Must be an &quot;id&quot; if `ids` is

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.

 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying outside the
 |          sector. This option refers to the root of the hierarchy

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines how the value is displayed on the graph.
 |          `number` displays the value numerically in text.
 |          `delta` displays the difference to a reference value in
 |          text. Finally, `gauge` displays the value graphically
 |          on an axis.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.

 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      value
 |          Sets the number to be displayed.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      Draws isosurfaces between iso-min and iso-max values with
 |      coordinates given by four 1-dimensional arrays containing the
 |      `value`, `x`, `y` and `z` of every vertex of a uniform or non-
 |      uniform 3-D grid. Horizontal or vertical slices, caps as well
 |      as spaceframe between iso-min and iso-max values could also be
 |      drawn using this trace.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      caps
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.isosurface.Caps` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here `value`) or the
 |          bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as `value`. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.isosurface.ColorBar`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied
 |          to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-
 |          poly look via flat reflections.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.isosurface.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      isomin
 |          Sets the minimum boundary for iso-surface plot.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.isosurface.Legendgrouptitl
 |          e` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      lighting
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.isosurface.Lighting`

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.

 |          Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arg
 |          instance of Image or dict with compatible properties
 |      layer
 |          Specifies whether images are drawn below or above
 |          traces. When `xref` and `yref` are both set to `paper`,
 |          image is drawn below the entire plot area.
 |      name
 |          When used in a template, named items are created in the
 |          output figure in addition to any items the figure
 |          already has in this array. You can modify these items
 |          in the output figure by making your own item with
 |          `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your
 |          modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
 |          false` to hide it). Has no effect outside of a
 |          template.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the image.
 |      sizex
 |          Sets the image container size horizontally. The image
 |          will be sized based on the `position` value. When
 |          `xref` is set to `paper`, units are sized relative to
 |          the plot width. When `xref` ends with ` domain`, units
 |          are sized relative to the axis width.
 |      sizey
 |          Sets the image container size vertically. The image
 |          will be sized based on the `position` value. When
 |          `yref` is set to `paper`, units are sized relative to
 |          the plot height. When `yref` ends with ` domain`, units
 |          are sized relative to the axis height.
 |      sizing
 |          Specifies which dimension of the image to constrain.
 |      source
 |          Specifies the URL of the image to be used. The URL must
 |          be accessible from the domain where the plot code is
 |          run, and can be either relative or absolute.
 |      templateitemname
 |          Used to refer to a named item in this array in the
 |          template. Named items from the template will be created
 |          even without a matching item in the input figure, but
 |          you can modify one by making an item with
 |          `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your
 |          modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
 |          false` to hide it). If there is no template or no
 |          matching item, this item will be hidden unless you
 |          explicitly show it with `visible: true`.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this image is visible.
 |      x
 |          Sets the image&#39;s x position. When `xref` is set to
 |          `paper`, units are sized relative to the plot height.
 |          See `xref` for more info
 |      xanchor
 |          Sets the anchor for the x position
 |      xref
 |          Sets the images&#39;s x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis
 |          id (e.g. &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x2&quot;), the `x` position refers to a x
 |          coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `x` position refers
 |          to the distance from the left of the plotting area in
 |          normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
 |          left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the left of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second x  axis and a x position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the left and the right of
 |          the domain of the second x axis.
 |      y
 |          Sets the image&#39;s y position. When `yref` is set to
 |          `paper`, units are sized relative to the plot height.
 |          See `yref` for more info
 |      yanchor
 |          Sets the anchor for the y position.
 |      yref
 |          Sets the images&#39;s y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis
 |          id (e.g. &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y2&quot;), the `y` position refers to a y
 |          coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `y` position refers
 |          to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in
 |          normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
 |          bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second y  axis and a y position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the bottom and the top of
 |          the domain of the second y axis.
 |      row
 |          Subplot row for image. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all rows in
 |          the specified column(s).
 |      col
 |          Subplot column for image. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y
 |          Whether to add image to secondary y-axis
 |      exclude_empty_subplots
 |          If True, image will not be added to subplots without
 |          traces.

 |      Add a new Mesh3d trace
 |      
 |      Draws sets of triangles with coordinates given by three
 |      1-dimensional arrays in `x`, `y`, `z` and (1) a sets of `i`,
 |      `j`, `k` indices (2) Delaunay triangulation or (3) the Alpha-
 |      shape algorithm or (4) the Convex-hull algorithm
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alphahull
 |          Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived
 |          from the set of vertices (points) represented by the
 |          `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays
 |          are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is
 |          preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If &quot;-1&quot;,
 |          Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly
 |          suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer
 |          surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In
 |          case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at
 |          more than one point it will result triangles that are
 |          very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If &quot;&gt;0&quot;,
 |          the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the
 |          positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the
 |          alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the
 |          parameter for the mesh fitting. If 0,  the convex-hull
 |          algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or
 |          if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z`
 |          point set into a convex hull.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here `intensity`) or
 |          the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to
 |          `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmin`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as `intensity`. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmax`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      color
 |          Sets the color of the whole mesh
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.ColorBar` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      delaunayaxis
 |          Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is
 |          perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay
 |          triangulation. It has an effect if `i`, `j`, `k` are
 |          not provided and `alphahull` is set to indicate
 |          Delaunay triangulation.
 |      facecolor
 |          Sets the color of each face Overrides &quot;color&quot; and
 |          &quot;vertexcolor&quot;.
 |      facecolorsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          facecolor .
 |      flatshading
 |          Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied
 |          to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-
 |          poly look via flat reflections.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .

 |      i
 |          A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between
 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the &quot;first&quot; vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `i[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `i` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the first vertex of a triangle.
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an

 |          ids .
 |      intensity
 |          Sets the intensity values for vertices or cells as
 |          defined by `intensitymode`. It can be used for plotting
 |          fields on meshes.
 |      intensitymode

 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the &quot;second&quot; vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}`  together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `j[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `j` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the second vertex of a triangle.
 |      jsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  j
 |          .
 |      k
 |          A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between
 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the &quot;third&quot; vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `k[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `k` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the third vertex of a triangle.
 |      ksrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  k
 |          .
 |      legendgroup

 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      lighting
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Lighting` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      lightposition
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Lightposition`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      vertexcolor
 |          Sets the color of each vertex Overrides &quot;color&quot;. While
 |          Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and
 |          255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA
 |          format, the alpha color should be normalized to be
 |          between 0 and 1.

 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with

 |      Add a new Ohlc trace
 |      
 |      The ohlc (short for Open-High-Low-Close) is a style of
 |      financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a
 |      given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The tip of the lines
 |      represent the `low` and `high` values and the horizontal
 |      segments represent the `open` and `close` values. Sample points
 |      where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are
 |      called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing items
 |      are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.
 |

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.ohlc.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each sample
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over

 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates. If absent, linear coordinate
 |          will be generated.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-

 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          alignment of data points on the x axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `yaxis.hoverformat`.

 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These

 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoveron
 |          Sets the hover interaction mode for the parcats
 |          diagram. If `category`, hover interaction take place
 |          per category. If `color`, hover interactions take place
 |          per color per category. If `dimension`, hover

 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      sortpaths
 |          Sets the path sorting algorithm. If `forward`, sort
 |          paths based on dimension categories from left to right.
 |          If `backward`, sort paths based on dimensions
 |          categories from right to left.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.parcats.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      tickfont
 |          Sets the font for the `category` labels.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all

 |      insidetextorientation
 |          Controls the orientation of the text inside chart
 |          sectors. When set to &quot;auto&quot;, text may be oriented in
 |          any direction in order to be as big as possible in the
 |          middle of a sector. The &quot;horizontal&quot; option orients
 |          text to be parallel with the bottom of the chart, and
 |          may make text smaller in order to achieve that goal.
 |          The &quot;radial&quot; option orients text along the radius of
 |          the sector. The &quot;tangential&quot; option orients text
 |          perpendicular to the radius of the sector.
 |      label0
 |          Alternate to `labels`. Builds a numeric set of labels.
 |          Use with `dlabel` where `label0` is the starting label
 |          and `dlabel` the step.
 |      labels
 |          Sets the sector labels. If `labels` entries are
 |          duplicated, we sum associated `values` or simply count
 |          occurrences if `values` is not provided. For other

 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbounds
 |          Specify `xbounds` in the shape of `[xMin, xMax] to

 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      xy
 |          Faster alternative to specifying `x` and `y`
 |          separately. If supplied, it must be a typed
 |          `Float32Array` array that represents points such that
 |          `xy[i * 2] = x[i]` and `xy[i * 2 + 1] = y[i]`

 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  xy
 |          .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybounds
 |          Specify `ybounds` in the shape of `[yMin, yMax] to
 |          avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in
 |          conjunction with `xy` and `xbounds` for the performance
 |          benefits.

 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy

 |      Add a new Sankey trace
 |      
 |      Sankey plots for network flow data analysis. The nodes are
 |      specified in `nodes` and the links between sources and targets
 |      in `links`. The colors are set in `nodes[i].color` and
 |      `links[i].color`, otherwise defaults are used.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arrangement
 |          If value is `snap` (the default), the node arrangement
 |          is assisted by automatic snapping of elements to
 |          preserve space between nodes specified via `nodepad`.
 |          If value is `perpendicular`, the nodes can only move
 |          along a line perpendicular to the flow. If value is
 |          `freeform`, the nodes can freely move on the plane. If
 |          value is `fixed`, the nodes are stationary.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      domain
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sankey.Domain` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired. Note that this attribute is
 |          superseded by `node.hoverinfo` and `node.hoverinfo` for
 |          nodes and links respectively.
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sankey.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sankey.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      link
 |          The links of the Sankey plot.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      node
 |          The nodes of the Sankey plot.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the Sankey diagram.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sankey.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font for node labels
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      valueformat
 |          Sets the value formatting rule using d3 formatting
 |          mini-languages which are very similar to those in
 |          Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format.
 |      valuesuffix
 |          Adds a unit to follow the value in the hover tooltip.
 |          Add a space if a separation is necessary from the
 |          value.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).

 |      Add a new Scatter trace
 |      
 |      The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts,
 |      text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter
 |      point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on
 |      the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are
 |      achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to
 |      numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      error_x
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.ErrorX` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.ErrorY` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &quot;none&quot; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &quot;tonexty&quot; (&quot;tonextx&quot;) if `orientation` is &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &quot;none&quot;. &quot;tozerox&quot; and &quot;tozeroy&quot;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &quot;tonextx&quot; and
 |          &quot;tonexty&quot; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &quot;tozerox&quot; and &quot;tozeroy&quot;. &quot;toself&quot; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &quot;tonext&quot; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &quot;toself&quot; if there is no trace before it. &quot;tonext&quot;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      groupnorm
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &quot;legendonly&quot; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
 |          this `stackgroup`. With &quot;fraction&quot;, the value of each
 |          trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
 |          trace values at that location. &quot;percent&quot; is the same
 |          but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
 |          multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
 |          subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &quot;toself&quot; or &quot;tonext&quot; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &quot;fills&quot;,
 |          otherwise it is &quot;points&quot;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &quot;text&quot; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &quot;lines+markers&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;lines&quot;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &quot;legendonly&quot; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With &quot;v&quot;
 |          (&quot;h&quot;), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
 |          Also affects the default value of `fill`.
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stackgaps
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &quot;legendonly&quot; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
 |          which other traces in this group have data but this one
 |          does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
 |          locations. With &quot;interpolate&quot; we linearly interpolate
 |          between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
 |          beyond the existing values.
 |      stackgroup
 |          Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
 |          same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
 |          their x values if `orientation` is &quot;h&quot;). If blank or
 |          omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
 |          turns `fill` on by default, using &quot;tonexty&quot; (&quot;tonextx&quot;)
 |          if `orientation` is &quot;h&quot; (&quot;v&quot;) and sets the default
 |          `mode` to &quot;lines&quot; irrespective of point count. You can
 |          only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
 |          a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
 |          other traces in the same group. With multiple
 |          `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
 |          fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
 |          later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          textposition .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          alignment of data points on the x axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `yaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      yperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the y
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      yperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      yperiodalignment

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      error_x
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter3d.ErrorX` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      error_y

 |      error_z
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter3d.ErrorZ` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter3d.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y,z)
 |          triplet. If a single string, the same string appears
 |          over all the data points. If an array of string, the
 |          items are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y,z)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter3d.Legendgrouptitle
 |          ` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &quot;text&quot; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &quot;lines+markers&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;lines&quot;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.

 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.

 |          Delaunay surface about the x, y, z respectively.
 |      surfacecolor
 |          Sets the surface fill color.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y,z)
 |          triplet. If a single string, the same string appears
 |          over all the data points. If an array of string, the
 |          items are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y,z)
 |          coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot;
 |          flag and &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be
 |          seen in the hover labels.

 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter3d.Textfont`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          textposition .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          which they lie
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &quot;none&quot;. scatterternary has a subset
 |          of the options available to scatter. &quot;toself&quot; connects
 |          the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the
 |          trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. &quot;tonext&quot;
 |          fills the space between two traces if one completely
 |          encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and
 |          behaves like &quot;toself&quot; if there is no trace before it.
 |          &quot;tonext&quot; should not be used if one trace does not
 |          enclose the other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent

 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          regions? If the fill is &quot;toself&quot; or &quot;tonext&quot; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &quot;fills&quot;,
 |          otherwise it is &quot;points&quot;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b)
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of strings, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b). To
 |          be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`

 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &quot;text&quot; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &quot;lines+markers&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;lines&quot;.

 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (a,b) point. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of strings, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b). If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          textposition .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by

 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |      Add a new Scattergl trace
 |      
 |      The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `x` and
 |      `y` using the WebGL plotting engine. Bubble charts are achieved
 |      by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to a numerical
 |      arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      error_x
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.ErrorX` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.ErrorY` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &quot;none&quot; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &quot;tonexty&quot; (&quot;tonextx&quot;) if `orientation` is &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &quot;none&quot;. &quot;tozerox&quot; and &quot;tozeroy&quot;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &quot;tonextx&quot; and
 |          &quot;tonexty&quot; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &quot;tozerox&quot; and &quot;tozeroy&quot;. &quot;toself&quot; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &quot;tonext&quot; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &quot;toself&quot; if there is no trace before it. &quot;tonext&quot;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .

 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Legendgrouptitle
 |          ` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      line
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Line` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Marker` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          textposition .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          alignment of data points on the x axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-

 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `yaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      yperiod
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the y
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be

 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.

 |          coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot;
 |          flag and &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be
 |          seen in the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the icon text font (color=mapbox.layer.paint.text-
 |          color, size=mapbox.layer.layout.text-size). Has an
 |          effect only when `type` is set to &quot;symbol&quot;.

 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `lat`, `lon`
 |          and `text`.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattermapbox.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      Add a new Scatterpolar trace
 |      
 |      The scatterpolar trace type encompasses line charts, scatter
 |      charts, text charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates.
 |      The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r`
 |      (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Text (appearing
 |      either on the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble
 |      charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or
 |      `marker.color` to numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &quot;none&quot;. scatterpolar has a subset of
 |          the options available to scatter. &quot;toself&quot; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &quot;tonext&quot; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &quot;toself&quot; if there is no trace before it. &quot;tonext&quot;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &quot;toself&quot; or &quot;tonext&quot; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &quot;fills&quot;,
 |          otherwise it is &quot;points&quot;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several

 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &quot;theta&quot; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &quot;linear&quot; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolar.Unselected`

 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      Add a new Scatterpolargl trace
 |      
 |      The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter
 |      charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL
 |      plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines
 |      is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble
 |      charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or
 |      `marker.color` to numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &quot;none&quot; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &quot;tonexty&quot; (&quot;tonextx&quot;) if `orientation` is &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &quot;none&quot;. &quot;tozerox&quot; and &quot;tozeroy&quot;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &quot;tonextx&quot; and
 |          &quot;tonexty&quot; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &quot;tozerox&quot; and &quot;tozeroy&quot;. &quot;toself&quot; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &quot;tonext&quot; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &quot;toself&quot; if there is no trace before it. &quot;tonext&quot;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be

 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.

 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects

 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for

 |          and `text`.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      theta
 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &quot;theta&quot; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &quot;linear&quot; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |      Add a new Scatterternary trace
 |      
 |      Provides similar functionality to the &quot;scatter&quot; type but on a
 |      ternary phase diagram. The data is provided by at least two
 |      arrays out of `a`, `b`, `c` triplets.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      a
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      asrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  a
 |          .
 |      b
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      bsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  b
 |          .
 |      c
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      csrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  c
 |          .
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &quot;none&quot;. scatterternary has a subset
 |          of the options available to scatter. &quot;toself&quot; connects
 |          the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the
 |          trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. &quot;tonext&quot;
 |          fills the space between two traces if one completely
 |          encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and
 |          behaves like &quot;toself&quot; if there is no trace before it.
 |          &quot;tonext&quot; should not be used if one trace does not
 |          enclose the other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .

 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterternary.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &quot;toself&quot; or &quot;tonext&quot; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &quot;fills&quot;,
 |          otherwise it is &quot;points&quot;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted

 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of strings, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c).
 |          To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &quot;text&quot;
 |          flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      line

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &quot;text&quot; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &quot;lines+markers&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;lines&quot;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.

 |          value), the data refer to `layout.ternary`. If
 |          &quot;ternary2&quot;, the data refer to `layout.ternary2`, and so
 |          on.
 |      sum
 |          The number each triplet should sum to, if only two of
 |          `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided. This overrides
 |          `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum` to normalize this specific trace, but
 |          does not affect the values displayed on the axes. 0 (or
 |          missing) means to use ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum

 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterternary.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arg
 |          instance of Shape or dict with compatible properties
 |      editable
 |          Determines whether the shape could be activated for
 |          edit or not. Has no effect when the older editable
 |          shapes mode is enabled via `config.editable` or
 |          `config.edits.shapePosition`.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the color filling the shape&#39;s interior. Only
 |          applies to closed shapes.
 |      fillrule
 |          Determines which regions of complex paths constitute
 |          the interior. For more info please visit
 |          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
 |          US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule
 |      layer
 |          Specifies whether shapes are drawn below or above
 |          traces.
 |      line
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.shape.Line`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      name
 |          When used in a template, named items are created in the
 |          output figure in addition to any items the figure
 |          already has in this array. You can modify these items
 |          in the output figure by making your own item with
 |          `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your
 |          modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
 |          false` to hide it). Has no effect outside of a
 |          template.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the shape.
 |      path
 |          For `type` &quot;path&quot; - a valid SVG path with the pixel
 |          values replaced by data values in
 |          `xsizemode`/`ysizemode` being &quot;scaled&quot; and taken
 |          unmodified as pixels relative to `xanchor` and
 |          `yanchor` in case of &quot;pixel&quot; size mode. There are a few
 |          restrictions / quirks only absolute instructions, not
 |          relative. So the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q,
 |          C, T, S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because radius
 |          rx and ry are relative. In the future we could consider
 |          supporting relative commands, but we would have to
 |          decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that
 |          even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on
 |          linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa.
 |          no chained &quot;polybezier&quot; commands - specify the segment
 |          type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers
 |          scaled to the serial numbers of categories because
 |          using the categories themselves there would be no way
 |          to describe fractional positions On data axes: because
 |          space and T are both normal components of path strings,
 |          we can&#39;t use either to separate date from time parts.
 |          Therefore we&#39;ll use underscore for this purpose:
 |          2015-02-21_13:45:56.789
 |      templateitemname
 |          Used to refer to a named item in this array in the
 |          template. Named items from the template will be created
 |          even without a matching item in the input figure, but
 |          you can modify one by making an item with
 |          `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your
 |          modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
 |          false` to hide it). If there is no template or no
 |          matching item, this item will be hidden unless you
 |          explicitly show it with `visible: true`.
 |      type
 |          Specifies the shape type to be drawn. If &quot;line&quot;, a line
 |          is drawn from (`x0`,`y0`) to (`x1`,`y1`) with respect
 |          to the axes&#39; sizing mode. If &quot;circle&quot;, a circle is
 |          drawn from ((`x0`+`x1`)/2, (`y0`+`y1`)/2)) with radius
 |          (|(`x0`+`x1`)/2 - `x0`|, |(`y0`+`y1`)/2 -`y0`)|) with
 |          respect to the axes&#39; sizing mode. If &quot;rect&quot;, a
 |          rectangle is drawn linking (`x0`,`y0`), (`x1`,`y0`),
 |          (`x1`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y0`) with respect to
 |          the axes&#39; sizing mode. If &quot;path&quot;, draw a custom SVG
 |          path using `path`. with respect to the axes&#39; sizing
 |          mode.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this shape is visible.
 |      x0
 |          Sets the shape&#39;s starting x position. See `type` and
 |          `xsizemode` for more info.
 |      x1
 |          Sets the shape&#39;s end x position. See `type` and
 |          `xsizemode` for more info.
 |      xanchor
 |          Only relevant in conjunction with `xsizemode` set to
 |          &quot;pixel&quot;. Specifies the anchor point on the x axis to
 |          which `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates within `path` are
 |          relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape
 |          to a certain data value. No effect when `xsizemode` not
 |          set to &quot;pixel&quot;.
 |      xref
 |          Sets the shape&#39;s x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis
 |          id (e.g. &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x2&quot;), the `x` position refers to a x
 |          coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `x` position refers
 |          to the distance from the left of the plotting area in
 |          normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
 |          left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the left of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second x  axis and a x position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the left and the right of
 |          the domain of the second x axis. If the axis `type` is
 |          &quot;log&quot;, then you must take the log of your desired
 |          range. If the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;, then you must
 |          convert the date to unix time in milliseconds.
 |      xsizemode
 |          Sets the shapes&#39;s sizing mode along the x axis. If set
 |          to &quot;scaled&quot;, `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates within `path`
 |          refer to data values on the x axis or a fraction of the
 |          plot area&#39;s width (`xref` set to &quot;paper&quot;). If set to
 |          &quot;pixel&quot;, `xanchor` specifies the x position in terms of
 |          data or plot fraction but `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates
 |          within `path` are pixels relative to `xanchor`. This
 |          way, the shape can have a fixed width while maintaining
 |          a position relative to data or plot fraction.
 |      y0
 |          Sets the shape&#39;s starting y position. See `type` and
 |          `ysizemode` for more info.
 |      y1
 |          Sets the shape&#39;s end y position. See `type` and
 |          `ysizemode` for more info.
 |      yanchor
 |          Only relevant in conjunction with `ysizemode` set to
 |          &quot;pixel&quot;. Specifies the anchor point on the y axis to
 |          which `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates within `path` are
 |          relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape
 |          to a certain data value. No effect when `ysizemode` not
 |          set to &quot;pixel&quot;.
 |      yref
 |          Sets the annotation&#39;s y coordinate axis. If set to a y
 |          axis id (e.g. &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y2&quot;), the `y` position refers to
 |          a y coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, the `y` position
 |          refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting
 |          area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds
 |          to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by
 |          &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position behaves
 |          like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the distance in
 |          fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the
 |          domain of that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the
 |          domain of the second y  axis and a y position of 0.5
 |          refers to the point between the bottom and the top of
 |          the domain of the second y axis.
 |      ysizemode
 |          Sets the shapes&#39;s sizing mode along the y axis. If set
 |          to &quot;scaled&quot;, `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates within `path`
 |          refer to data values on the y axis or a fraction of the
 |          plot area&#39;s height (`yref` set to &quot;paper&quot;). If set to
 |          &quot;pixel&quot;, `yanchor` specifies the y position in terms of
 |          data or plot fraction but `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates
 |          within `path` are pixels relative to `yanchor`. This
 |          way, the shape can have a fixed height while
 |          maintaining a position relative to data or plot
 |          fraction.
 |      row
 |          Subplot row for shape. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all rows in
 |          the specified column(s).
 |      col
 |          Subplot column for shape. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          columns in the specified row(s).
 |      secondary_y
 |          Whether to add shape to secondary y-axis
 |      exclude_empty_subplots
 |          If True, shape will not be added to subplots without
 |          traces.

 |      Add a new Splom trace
 |      
 |      Splom traces generate scatter plot matrix visualizations. Each
 |      splom `dimensions` items correspond to a generated axis. Values
 |      for each of those dimensions are set in `dimensions[i].values`.
 |      Splom traces support all `scattergl` marker style attributes.
 |      Specify `layout.grid` attributes and/or layout x-axis and
 |      y-axis attributes for more control over the axis positioning
 |      and style.
 |

 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .

 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.splom.Marker` instance or

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .

 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.splom.Selected` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showlowerhalf
 |          Determines whether or not subplots on the lower half
 |          from the diagonal are displayed.
 |      showupperhalf
 |          Determines whether or not subplots on the upper half
 |          from the diagonal are displayed.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.splom.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair to
 |          appear on hover. If a single string, the same string
 |          appears over all the data points. If an array of
 |          string, the items are mapped in order to the this
 |          trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.splom.Unselected` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      xaxes
 |          Sets the list of x axes corresponding to dimensions of
 |          this splom trace. By default, a splom will match the
 |          first N xaxes where N is the number of input
 |          dimensions. Note that, in case where `diagonal.visible`
 |          is false and `showupperhalf` or `showlowerhalf` is
 |          false, this splom trace will generate one less x-axis
 |          and one less y-axis.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      yaxes
 |          Sets the list of y axes corresponding to dimensions of
 |          this splom trace. By default, a splom will match the
 |          first N yaxes where N is the number of input
 |          dimensions. Note that, in case where `diagonal.visible`
 |          is false and `showupperhalf` or `showlowerhalf` is
 |          false, this splom trace will generate one less x-axis
 |          and one less y-axis.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-

 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `yaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)

 |      Add a new Streamtube trace
 |      
 |      Use a streamtube trace to visualize flow in a vector field.
 |      Specify a vector field using 6 1D arrays of equal length, 3
 |      position arrays `x`, `y` and `z` and 3 vector component arrays
 |      `u`, `v`, and `w`.  By default, the tubes&#39; starting positions
 |      will be cut from the vector field&#39;s x-z plane at its minimum y
 |      value. To specify your own starting position, use attributes
 |      `starts.x`, `starts.y` and `starts.z`. The color is encoded by
 |      the norm of (u, v, w), and the local radius by the divergence
 |      of (u, v, w).
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here u/v/w norm) or the
 |          bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, `cmin`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, `cmax`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.ColorBar`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.Hoverlabel`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available. variables `tubex`, `tubey`, `tubez`,
 |          `tubeu`, `tubev`, `tubew`, `norm` and `divergence`.
 |          Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the
 |          secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.Legendgrouptitl
 |          e` instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      lighting
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.Lighting`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      lightposition
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.Lightposition`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      maxdisplayed
 |          The maximum number of displayed segments in a
 |          streamtube.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      sizeref
 |          The scaling factor for the streamtubes. The default is
 |          1, which avoids two max divergence tubes from touching
 |          at adjacent starting positions.
 |      starts
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.Starts`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.streamtube.Stream`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets a text element associated with this trace. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag, this text
 |          element will be seen in all hover labels. Note that
 |          streamtube traces do not support array `text` values.
 |      u
 |          Sets the x components of the vector field.
 |      uhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `u`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format.By
 |          default the values are formatted using generic number
 |          format.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      usrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  u
 |          .
 |      v
 |          Sets the y components of the vector field.

 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      branchvalues
 |          Determines how the items in `values` are summed. When
 |          set to &quot;total&quot;, items in `values` are taken to be value
 |          of all its descendants. When set to &quot;remainder&quot;, items
 |          in `values` corresponding to the root and the branches
 |          sectors are taken to be the extra part not part of the
 |          sum of the values at their leaves.
 |      count
 |          Determines default for `values` when it is not
 |          provided, by inferring a 1 for each of the &quot;leaves&quot;
 |          and/or &quot;branches&quot;, otherwise 0.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.

 |          are available. variables `currentPath`, `root`,
 |          `entry`, `percentRoot`, `percentEntry` and
 |          `percentParent`. Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each sector.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears for all
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order of this trace&#39;s sectors. To be seen,
 |          trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      insidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying inside the
 |          sector.
 |      insidetextorientation
 |          Controls the orientation of the text inside chart
 |          sectors. When set to &quot;auto&quot;, text may be oriented in
 |          any direction in order to be as big as possible in the
 |          middle of a sector. The &quot;horizontal&quot; option orients
 |          text to be parallel with the bottom of the chart, and
 |          may make text smaller in order to achieve that goal.
 |          The &quot;radial&quot; option orients text along the radius of
 |          the sector. The &quot;tangential&quot; option orients text
 |          perpendicular to the radius of the sector.
 |      labels
 |          Sets the labels of each of the sectors.
 |      labelssrc

 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      level
 |          Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is
 |          rendered. Set `level` to `&#39;&#39;` to start from the root
 |          node in the hierarchy. Must be an &quot;id&quot; if `ids` is
 |          filled in, otherwise plotly attempts to find a matching
 |          item in `labels`.
 |      marker
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sunburst.Marker` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      maxdepth
 |          Sets the number of rendered sectors from any given
 |          `level`. Set `maxdepth` to &quot;-1&quot; to render all the
 |          levels in the hierarchy.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying outside the
 |          sector. This option refers to the root of the hierarchy
 |          presented at the center of a sunburst graph. Please
 |          note that if a hierarchy has multiple root nodes, this
 |          option won&#39;t have any effect and `insidetextfont` would
 |          be used.
 |      parents
 |          Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty
 |          string items &#39;&#39; are understood to reference the root
 |          node in the hierarchy. If `ids` is filled, `parents`
 |          items are understood to be &quot;ids&quot; themselves. When `ids`
 |          is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in
 |          `labels`, but beware they must be unique.
 |      parentssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          parents .
 |      root
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sunburst.Root` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      rotation
 |          Rotates the whole diagram counterclockwise by some
 |          angle. By default the first slice starts at 3 o&#39;clock.
 |      sort

 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sunburst.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each sector. If
 |          trace `textinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag, these elements
 |          will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`
 |          contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set,
 |          these elements will be seen in the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `textinfo`.
 |      textinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example

 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables
 |          `currentPath`, `root`, `entry`, `percentRoot`,
 |          `percentEntry`, `percentParent`, `label` and `value`.
 |      texttemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          texttemplate .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      values
 |          Sets the values associated with each of the sectors.
 |          Use with `branchvalues` to determine how the values are
 |          summed.
 |      valuessrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          values .
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |      Add a new Surface trace
 |      
 |      The data the describes the coordinates of the surface is set in
 |      `z`. Data in `z` should be a 2D list. Coordinates in `x` and
 |      `y` can either be 1D lists or 2D lists (e.g. to graph
 |      parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and
 |      y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a
 |      unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by
 |      default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which
 |      should be a 2D list, where its bounds can be controlled using
 |      `cmin` and `cmax`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here z or surfacecolor)
 |          or the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to
 |          `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as z or surfacecolor and if set,
 |          `cmin` must be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as z or surfacecolor.
 |          Has no effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as z or surfacecolor and if set,
 |          `cmax` must be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.ColorBar` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          customdata .
 |      hidesurface
 |          Determines whether or not a surface is drawn. For
 |          example, set `hidesurface` to False `contours.x.show`
 |          to True and `contours.y.show` to True to draw a wire
 |          frame plot.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
 |          using d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
 |          example &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. The variables
 |          available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as
 |          event data described at this link
 |          https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
 |          data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
 |          specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .

 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      lighting
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Lighting` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      opacityscale
 |          Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an
 |          array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to
 |          an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest
 |          (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example,
 |          `[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]` means that higher/lower
 |          values would have higher opacity values and those in
 |          the middle would be more transparent Alternatively,
 |          `opacityscale` may be a palette name string of the
 |          following list: &#39;min&#39;, &#39;max&#39;, &#39;extremes&#39; and &#39;uniform&#39;.
 |          The default is &#39;uniform&#39;.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      surfacecolor
 |          Sets the surface color values, used for setting a color
 |          scale independent of `z`.
 |      surfacecolorsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          surfacecolor .
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.table.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all
 |          rows in the specified column(s).
 |      col : &#39;all&#39;, int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all

 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each sector.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears for all
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order of this trace&#39;s sectors. To be seen,

 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      level
 |          Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is
 |          rendered. Set `level` to `&#39;&#39;` to start from the root

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying outside the
 |          sector. This option refers to the root of the hierarchy
 |          presented on top left corner of a treemap graph. Please
 |          note that if a hierarchy has multiple root nodes, this
 |          option won&#39;t have any effect and `insidetextfont` would
 |          be used.
 |      parents
 |          Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty
 |          string items &#39;&#39; are understood to reference the root
 |          node in the hierarchy. If `ids` is filled, `parents`
 |          items are understood to be &quot;ids&quot; themselves. When `ids`
 |          is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in
 |          `labels`, but beware they must be unique.

 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each sector. If
 |          trace `textinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag, these elements
 |          will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`
 |          contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set,
 |          these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

 |          are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertemplate .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          ids .
 |      jitter
 |          Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.
 |          If 0, the sample points align along the distribution
 |          axis. If 1, the sample points are drawn in a random
 |          jitter of width equal to the width of the violins.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover. For violin traces, the name
 |          will also be used for the position coordinate, if `x`
 |          and `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and
 |          the position axis is categorical. Note that the trace
 |          name is also used as a default value for attribute
 |          `scalegroup` (please see its description for details).
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;),
 |          the distribution is visualized along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      pointpos
 |          Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
 |          the violins. If 0, the sample points are places over
 |          the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values
 |          correspond to positions to the right (left) for
 |          vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal
 |          violins.
 |      points
 |          If &quot;outliers&quot;, only the sample points lying outside the
 |          whiskers are shown If &quot;suspectedoutliers&quot;, the outlier
 |          points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3
 |          or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
 |          `outliercolor`) If &quot;all&quot;, all sample points are shown
 |          If False, only the violins are shown with no sample
 |          points. Defaults to &quot;suspectedoutliers&quot; when
 |          `marker.outliercolor` or `marker.line.outliercolor` is
 |          set, otherwise defaults to &quot;outliers&quot;.
 |      scalegroup
 |          If there are multiple violins that should be sized
 |          according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link
 |          them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by
 |          every trace in the same group. If a violin&#39;s `width` is
 |          undefined, `scalegroup` will default to the trace&#39;s
 |          name. In this case, violins with the same names will be
 |          linked together
 |      scalemode
 |          Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is
 |          determined.&quot;width&quot; means each violin has the same (max)
 |          width*count* means the violins are scaled by the number
 |          of sample points makingup each violin.
 |      selected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Selected` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      side
 |          Determines on which side of the position value the
 |          density function making up one half of a violin is
 |          plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under
 |          &quot;overlay&quot; mode, where one trace has `side` set to
 |          &quot;positive&quot; and the other to &quot;negative&quot;.
 |      span
 |          Sets the span in data space for which the density
 |          function will be computed. Has an effect only when
 |          `spanmode` is set to &quot;manual&quot;.
 |      spanmode
 |          Sets the method by which the span in data space where
 |          the density function will be computed. &quot;soft&quot; means the
 |          span goes from the sample&#39;s minimum value minus two
 |          bandwidths to the sample&#39;s maximum value plus two
 |          bandwidths. &quot;hard&quot; means the span goes from the
 |          sample&#39;s minimum to its maximum value. For custom span
 |          settings, use mode &quot;manual&quot; and fill in the `span`
 |          attribute.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Stream` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each sample
 |          value. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &quot;text&quot; flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Unselected`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If 0
 |          (default value) the width is automatically selected
 |          based on the positions of other violin traces in the
 |          same subplot.
 |      x
 |          Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.
 |      x0
 |          Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the
 |          starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
 |          q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
 |          those in Python. For numbers, see:
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for
 |          dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
 |          tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display *09~15~23.46*By
 |          default the values are formatted using
 |          `xaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.
 |      y0
 |          Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the
 |          starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
 |          q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to

 |      Add a new Volume trace
 |      
 |      Draws volume trace between iso-min and iso-max values with
 |      coordinates given by four 1-dimensional arrays containing the
 |      `value`, `x`, `y` and `z` of every vertex of a uniform or non-
 |      uniform 3-D grid. Horizontal or vertical slices, caps as well
 |      as spaceframe between iso-min and iso-max values could also be
 |      drawn using this trace.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      caps
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Caps` instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here `value`) or the
 |          bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as `value`. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &quot;coloraxis&quot;, &quot;coloraxis2&quot;,
 |          &quot;coloraxis3&quot;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.ColorBar` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;], [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      legendgrouptitle
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Legendgrouptitle`
 |          instance or dict with compatible properties
 |      legendrank
 |          Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
 |          with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
 |          with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
 |          bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
 |          that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
 |          items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
 |          1000 to go after all unranked items.
 |      lighting
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Lighting` instance

 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      opacityscale
 |          Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an
 |          array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to
 |          an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest
 |          (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example,
 |          `[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]` means that higher/lower
 |          values would have higher opacity values and those in
 |          the middle would be more transparent Alternatively,
 |          `opacityscale` may be a palette name string of the
 |          following list: &#39;min&#39;, &#39;max&#39;, &#39;extremes&#39; and &#39;uniform&#39;.
 |          The default is &#39;uniform&#39;.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &quot;scene&quot; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &quot;scene2&quot;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.

 |      surface
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Surface` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      value
 |          Sets the 4th dimension (value) of the vertices.
 |      valuehoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `value`  using

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls

 |          or independently.
 |      base
 |          Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
 |          units).
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
 |          subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
 |          and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
 |          `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.

 |          be no larger than the bar itself.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &quot;scatter&quot; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements

 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.

 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot; as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
 |          {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
 |          points, &quot;xother&quot; will be added to those with different
 |          x positions from the first point. An underscore before
 |          or after &quot;(x|y)other&quot; will add a space on that side,
 |          only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted

 |          are available. variables `initial`, `delta` and
 |          `final`. Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &quot;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&quot;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |      measure
 |          An array containing types of values. By default the
 |          values are considered as &#39;relative&#39;. However; it is
 |          possible to use &#39;total&#39; to compute the sums. Also
 |          &#39;absolute&#39; could be applied to reset the computed total

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
 |          meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
 |          axis units). In &quot;group&quot; barmode, traces that set
 |          &quot;offset&quot; will be excluded and drawn in &quot;overlay&quot; mode
 |          instead.
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      offsetsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the bars. With &quot;v&quot; (&quot;h&quot;), the
 |          value of the each bar spans along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Stream` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &quot;text&quot; flag and
 |          &quot;hovertext&quot; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
 |          bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
 |          labels vertically. With &quot;auto&quot; the texts may
 |          automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
 |          in bars.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
 |          In the case of having multiple waterfalls, totals are
 |          computed separately (per trace).
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &quot;inside&quot;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &quot;outside&quot; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &quot;auto&quot; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
 |          &quot;none&quot;, no text appears.

 |      texttemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information text
 |          that appear on points. Note that this will override
 |          `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &quot;y: %{y}&quot;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &quot;Price: %{y:$.2f}&quot;. https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-
 |          reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for
 |          details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted
 |          using d3-time-format&#39;s syntax %{variable|d3-time-
 |          format}, for example &quot;Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}&quot;.
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for
 |          details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
 |          that can be specified per-point (the ones that are
 |          `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `initial`,
 |          `delta`, `final` and `label`.

 |      totals
 |          :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Totals` instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &quot;legendonly&quot;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar width (in position axis units).

 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &quot;x&quot; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &quot;x2&quot;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to

 |          format#locale_format. We add two items to d3&#39;s date
 |          formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of the year as a decimal
 |          number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; for fractional seconds with n
 |          digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with

 |          period positioning in milliseconds or &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; on the x
 |          axis. Special values in the form of &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; could be
 |          used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
 |          must be a positive integer.
 |      xperiod0
 |          Only relevant when the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;. Sets the
 |          base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
 |          string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
 |          of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
 |          Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
 |          2000-01-01.
 |      xperiodalignment

 |          alignment of data points on the x axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for  x
 |          .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &quot;y&quot; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &quot;y2&quot;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
 |          formatting mini-languages which are very similar to

 |          `yaxis.hoverformat`.
 |      yperiod

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      data : list[BaseTraceType or dict]
 |          A list of trace specifications to be added.
 |          Trace specifications may be either:
 |      
 |            - Instances of trace classes from the plotly.graph_objs

 |      
 |                - The &#39;type&#39; property specifies the trace type (e.g.
 |                  &#39;scatter&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;area&#39;, etc.). If the dict has no &#39;type&#39;

 |                - All remaining properties are passed to the constructor
 |                  of the specified trace type.
 |      
 |      rows : None, list[int], or int (default None)
 |          List of subplot row indexes (starting from 1) for the traces to be

 |      y-dimension.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      x: float or int
 |          A number representing the x coordinate of the vertical line.
 |      exclude_empty_subplots: Boolean
 |          If True (default) do not place the shape on subplots that have no data
 |          plotted on them.
 |      row: None, int or &#39;all&#39;
 |          Subplot row for shape indexed starting at 1. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all rows in
 |          the specified column(s). If both row and col are None, addresses the
 |          first subplot if subplots exist, or the only plot. By default is &quot;all&quot;.
 |      col: None, int or &#39;all&#39;
 |          Subplot column for shape indexed starting at 1. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all rows in
 |          the specified column(s). If both row and col are None, addresses the
 |          first subplot if subplots exist, or the only plot. By default is &quot;all&quot;.
 |      annotation: dict or plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation. If dict(),
 |          it is interpreted as describing an annotation. The annotation is
 |          placed relative to the shape based on annotation_position (see
 |          below) unless its x or y value has been specified for the annotation
 |          passed here. xref and yref are always the same as for the added

 |      annotation_position: a string containing optionally [&quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;]
 |          and [&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] specifying where the text should be anchored
 |          to on the line. Example positions are &quot;bottom left&quot;, &quot;right top&quot;,
 |          &quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;. If an annotation is added but annotation_position is
 |          not specified, this defaults to &quot;top right&quot;.
 |      annotation_*: any parameters to go.layout.Annotation can be passed as
 |          keywords by prefixing them with &quot;annotation_&quot;. For example, to specify the
 |          annotation text &quot;example&quot; you can pass annotation_text=&quot;example&quot; as a
 |          keyword argument.
 |      **kwargs:
 |          Any named function parameters that can be passed to &#39;add_shape&#39;,
 |          except for x0, x1, y0, y1 or type.

 |          A number representing the x coordinate of one side of the rectangle.
 |      x1: float or int
 |          A number representing the x coordinate of the other side of the rectangle.
 |      exclude_empty_subplots: Boolean
 |          If True (default) do not place the shape on subplots that have no data
 |          plotted on them.
 |      row: None, int or &#39;all&#39;
 |          Subplot row for shape indexed starting at 1. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all rows in
 |          the specified column(s). If both row and col are None, addresses the
 |          first subplot if subplots exist, or the only plot. By default is &quot;all&quot;.
 |      col: None, int or &#39;all&#39;
 |          Subplot column for shape indexed starting at 1. If &#39;all&#39;, addresses all rows in
 |          the specified column(s). If both row and col are None, addresses the
 |          first subplot if subplots exist, or the only plot. By default is &quot;all&quot;.
 |      annotation: dict or plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation. If dict(),
 |          it is interpreted as describing an annotation. The annotation is
 |          placed relative to the shape based on annotation_position (see
 |          below) unless its x or y value has been specified for the annotation
 |          passed here. xref and yref are always the same as for the added

 |      annotation_position: a string containing optionally [&quot;inside&quot;, &quot;outside&quot;], [&quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;]
 |          and [&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] specifying where the text should be anchored
 |          to on the rectangle. Example positions are &quot;outside top left&quot;, &quot;inside
 |          bottom&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;inside left&quot;, &quot;inside&quot; (&quot;outside&quot; is not supported). If
 |          an annotation is added but annotation_position is not specified this
 |          defaults to &quot;inside top right&quot;.
 |      annotation_*: any parameters to go.layout.Annotation can be passed as
 |          keywords by prefixing them with &quot;annotation_&quot;. For example, to specify the
 |          annotation text &quot;example&quot; you can pass annotation_text=&quot;example&quot; as a
 |          keyword argument.
 |      **kwargs:

 |          except for x0, x1, y0, y1 or type.
 |  
 |  append_trace(self, trace, row, col)
 |      Add a trace to the figure bound to axes at the specified row,
 |      col index.

 |      method
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      trace

 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; # stack two subplots vertically
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = tools.make_subplots(rows=2)
 |      
 |      This is the format of your plot grid:
 |      [ (1,1) x1,y1 ]
 |      [ (2,1) x2,y2 ]
 |

 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.append_trace(go.Scatter(x=[1,2,3], y=[2,1,2]), row=2, col=1)
 |  
 |  batch_animate(self, duration=500, easing=&#39;cubic-in-out&#39;)
 |      Context manager to animate trace / layout updates
 |      
 |      Parameters

 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      Suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single trace.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |      
 |      1) Animate a change in the xaxis and yaxis ranges using default
 |      duration and easing parameters.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_animate():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      
 |      2) Animate a change in the size and color of the trace&#39;s markers
 |      over 2 seconds using the elastic-in-out easing method
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_animate(duration=2000, easing=&#39;elastic-in-out&#39;):
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.size = 20
 |  
 |  batch_update(self)
 |      A context manager that batches up trace and layout assignment
 |      operations into a singe plotly_update message that is executed when
 |      the context exits.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      For example, suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single
 |      trace.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |      
 |      If we want to update the xaxis range, the yaxis range, and the
 |      marker color, we could do so using a series of three property
 |      assignments as follows:
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      
 |      This will work, however it will result in three messages being
 |      sent to the front end (two relayout messages for the axis range
 |      updates followed by one restyle message for the marker color
 |      update). This can cause the plot to appear to stutter as the
 |      three updates are applied incrementally.
 |      
 |      We can avoid this problem by performing these three assignments in a
 |      `batch_update` context as follows:
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      
 |      Now, these three property updates will be sent to the frontend in a
 |      single update message, and they will be applied by the front end
 |      simultaneously.
 |  
 |  for_each_trace(self, fn, selector=None, row=None, col=None, secondary_y=None)
 |      Apply a function to all traces that satisfy the specified selection
 |      criteria
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      fn:
 |          Function that inputs a single trace object.
 |      selector: dict, function, int, str or None (default None)
 |          Dict to use as selection criteria.
 |          Traces will be selected if they contain properties corresponding
 |          to all of the dictionary&#39;s keys, with values that exactly match
 |          the supplied values. If None (the default), all traces are
 |          selected. If a function, it must be a function accepting a single
 |          argument and returning a boolean. The function will be called on
 |          each trace and those for which the function returned True
 |          will be in the selection. If an int N, the Nth trace matching row
 |          and col will be selected (N can be negative). If a string S, the selector
 |          is equivalent to dict(type=S).
 |      row, col: int or None (default None)
 |          Subplot row and column index of traces to select.
 |          To select traces by row and column, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots.  If None
 |          (the default), all traces are selected.
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          * If True, only select traces associated with the secondary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If False, only select traces associated with the primary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If None (the default), do not filter traces based on secondary
 |            y-axis.
 |      
 |          To select traces by secondary y-axis, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots. See the docstring
 |          for the specs argument to make_subplots for more info on
 |          creating subplots with secondary y-axes.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      self
 |          Returns the Figure object that the method was called on
 |  
 |  full_figure_for_development(self, warn=True, as_dict=False)
 |      Compute default values for all attributes not specified in the input figure and
 |      returns the output as a &quot;full&quot; figure. This function calls Plotly.js via Kaleido
 |      to populate unspecified attributes. This function is intended for interactive use
 |      during development to learn more about how Plotly.js computes default values and is
 |      not generally necessary or recommended for production use.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      fig:
 |          Figure object or dict representing a figure
 |      
 |      warn: bool
 |          If False, suppress warnings about not using this in production.
 |      
 |      as_dict: bool
 |          If True, output is a dict with some keys that go.Figure can&#39;t parse.
 |          If False, output is a go.Figure with unparseable keys skipped.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      plotly.graph_objects.Figure or dict
 |          The full figure
 |  
 |  get_subplot(self, row, col, secondary_y=False)
 |      Return an object representing the subplot at the specified row
 |      and column.  May only be used on Figures created using
 |      plotly.tools.make_subplots
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      row: int
 |          1-based index of subplot row
 |      col: int
 |          1-based index of subplot column
 |      secondary_y: bool
 |          If True, select the subplot that consists of the x-axis and the
 |          secondary y-axis at the specified row/col. Only valid if the
 |          subplot at row/col is an 2D cartesian subplot that was created
 |          with a secondary y-axis.  See the docstring for the specs argument
 |          to make_subplots for more info on creating a subplot with a
 |          secondary y-axis.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      subplot
 |          * None: if subplot is empty
 |          * plotly.graph_objs.layout.Scene: if subplot type is &#39;scene&#39;
 |          * plotly.graph_objs.layout.Polar: if subplot type is &#39;polar&#39;
 |          * plotly.graph_objs.layout.Ternary: if subplot type is &#39;ternary&#39;
 |          * plotly.graph_objs.layout.Mapbox: if subplot type is &#39;ternary&#39;
 |          * SubplotDomain namedtuple with `x` and `y` fields:

 |  
 |  plotly_relayout(self, relayout_data, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly relayout operation on the figure&#39;s layout
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      relayout_data : dict
 |          Dict of layout updates
 |      
 |          dict keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;xaxis.range&#39;)
 |      
 |          dict values are the values to use to update the layout.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  plotly_restyle(self, restyle_data, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly restyle operation on the figure&#39;s traces
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      restyle_data : dict
 |          Dict of trace style updates.
 |      
 |          Keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;marker.color&#39;).
 |      
 |          Values may be scalars or lists. When values are scalars,
 |          that scalar value is applied to all traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.  When values are lists,
 |          the restyle operation will cycle through the elements
 |          of the list as it cycles through the traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.
 |      
 |          Caution: To use plotly_restyle to update a list property (e.g.
 |          the `x` property of the scatter trace), the property value
 |          should be a scalar list containing the list to update with. For
 |          example, the following command would be used to update the &#39;x&#39;
 |          property of the first trace to the list [1, 2, 3]
 |      
 |          &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objects as go
 |          &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.Figure(go.Scatter(x=[2, 4, 6]))
 |          &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.plotly_restyle({&#39;x&#39;: [[1, 2, 3]]}, 0)
 |      
 |      trace_indexes : int or list of int
 |          Trace index, or list of trace indexes, that the restyle operation
 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  plotly_update(self, restyle_data=None, relayout_data=None, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly update operation on the figure.
 |      
 |      Note: This operation both mutates and returns the figure
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      restyle_data : dict
 |          Traces update specification. See the docstring for the
 |          `plotly_restyle` method for details
 |      relayout_data : dict
 |          Layout update specification. See the docstring for the
 |          `plotly_relayout` method for details
 |      trace_indexes :
 |          Trace index, or list of trace indexes, that the update operation
 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.
 |

 |      -------
 |      BaseFigure
 |          None
 |  
 |  pop(self, key, *args)
 |      Remove the value associated with the specified key and return it
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      key: str
 |          Property name
 |      dflt
 |          The default value to return if key was not found in figure
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      value
 |          The removed value that was previously associated with key
 |      
 |      Raises
 |      ------
 |      KeyError
 |          If key is not in object and no dflt argument specified
 |  
 |  print_grid(self)
 |      Print a visual layout of the figure&#39;s axes arrangement.
 |      This is only valid for figures that are created
 |      with plotly.tools.make_subplots.
 |  
 |  select_traces(self, selector=None, row=None, col=None, secondary_y=None)
 |      Select traces from a particular subplot cell and/or traces
 |      that satisfy custom selection criteria.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      selector: dict, function, int, str or None (default None)
 |          Dict to use as selection criteria.
 |          Traces will be selected if they contain properties corresponding
 |          to all of the dictionary&#39;s keys, with values that exactly match
 |          the supplied values. If None (the default), all traces are
 |          selected. If a function, it must be a function accepting a single
 |          argument and returning a boolean. The function will be called on
 |          each trace and those for which the function returned True
 |          will be in the selection. If an int N, the Nth trace matching row
 |          and col will be selected (N can be negative). If a string S, the selector
 |          is equivalent to dict(type=S).
 |      row, col: int or None (default None)
 |          Subplot row and column index of traces to select.
 |          To select traces by row and column, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots.  If None
 |          (the default), all traces are selected.
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          * If True, only select traces associated with the secondary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If False, only select traces associated with the primary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If None (the default), do not filter traces based on secondary
 |            y-axis.
 |      
 |          To select traces by secondary y-axis, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots. See the docstring
 |          for the specs argument to make_subplots for more info on
 |          creating subplots with secondary y-axes.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      generator
 |          Generator that iterates through all of the traces that satisfy
 |          all of the specified selection criteria
 |  
 |  set_subplots(self, rows=None, cols=None, **make_subplots_args)
 |      Add subplots to this figure. If the figure already contains subplots,
 |      then this throws an error. Accepts any keyword arguments that
 |      plotly.subplots.make_subplots accepts.
 |  
 |  show(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Show a figure using either the default renderer(s) or the renderer(s)
 |      specified by the renderer argument
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      renderer: str or None (default None)
 |          A string containing the names of one or more registered renderers
 |          (separated by &#39;+&#39; characters) or None.  If None, then the default
 |          renderers specified in plotly.io.renderers.default are used.
 |      
 |      validate: bool (default True)
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being shown,
 |          False otherwise.
 |      
 |      width: int or float
 |          An integer or float that determines the number of pixels wide the
 |          plot is. The default is set in plotly.js.
 |      
 |      height: int or float
 |          An integer or float that determines the number of pixels wide the
 |          plot is. The default is set in plotly.js.
 |      
 |      config: dict
 |          A dict of parameters to configure the figure. The defaults are set
 |          in plotly.js.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  to_dict(self)
 |      Convert figure to a dictionary
 |      
 |      Note: the dictionary includes the properties explicitly set by the
 |      user, it does not include default values of unspecified properties
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      dict
 |  
 |  to_html(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Convert a figure to an HTML string representation.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      config: dict or None (default None)
 |          Plotly.js figure config options
 |      auto_play: bool (default=True)
 |          Whether to automatically start the animation sequence on page load
 |          if the figure contains frames. Has no effect if the figure does not
 |          contain frames.
 |      include_plotlyjs: bool or string (default True)
 |          Specifies how the plotly.js library is included/loaded in the output
 |          div string.
 |      
 |          If True, a script tag containing the plotly.js source code (~3MB)
 |          is included in the output.  HTML files generated with this option are
 |          fully self-contained and can be used offline.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references the plotly.js CDN is included
 |          in the output. HTML files generated with this option are about 3MB
 |          smaller than those generated with include_plotlyjs=True, but they
 |          require an active internet connection in order to load the plotly.js
 |          library.
 |      
 |          If &#39;directory&#39;, a script tag is included that references an external
 |          plotly.min.js bundle that is assumed to reside in the same
 |          directory as the HTML file.
 |      
 |          If &#39;require&#39;, Plotly.js is loaded using require.js.  This option
 |          assumes that require.js is globally available and that it has been
 |          globally configured to know how to find Plotly.js as &#39;plotly&#39;.
 |          This option is not advised when full_html=True as it will result
 |          in a non-functional html file.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point
 |          the resulting HTML file to an alternative CDN or local bundle.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing plotly.js is included. This is
 |          useful when the resulting div string will be placed inside an HTML
 |          document that already loads plotly.js. This option is not advised
 |          when full_html=True as it will result in a non-functional html file.
 |      include_mathjax: bool or string (default False)
 |          Specifies how the MathJax.js library is included in the output html
 |          div string.  MathJax is required in order to display labels
 |          with LaTeX typesetting.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing MathJax.js will be included in the
 |          output.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references a MathJax CDN location will be
 |          included in the output.  HTML div strings generated with this option
 |          will be able to display LaTeX typesetting as long as internet access
 |          is available.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point the
 |          resulting HTML div string to an alternative CDN.
 |      post_script: str or list or None (default None)
 |          JavaScript snippet(s) to be included in the resulting div just after
 |          plot creation.  The string(s) may include &#39;{plot_id}&#39; placeholders
 |          that will then be replaced by the `id` of the div element that the
 |          plotly.js figure is associated with.  One application for this script
 |          is to install custom plotly.js event handlers.
 |      full_html: bool (default True)
 |          If True, produce a string containing a complete HTML document
 |          starting with an &lt;html&gt; tag.  If False, produce a string containing
 |          a single &lt;div&gt; element.
 |      animation_opts: dict or None (default None)
 |          dict of custom animation parameters to be passed to the function
 |          Plotly.animate in Plotly.js. See
 |          https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/src/plots/animation_attributes.js
 |          for available options. Has no effect if the figure does not contain
 |          frames, or auto_play is False.
 |      default_width, default_height: number or str (default &#39;100%&#39;)
 |          The default figure width/height to use if the provided figure does not
 |          specify its own layout.width/layout.height property.  May be
 |          specified in pixels as an integer (e.g. 500), or as a css width style
 |          string (e.g. &#39;500px&#39;, &#39;100%&#39;).
 |      validate: bool (default True)
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being converted to
 |          JSON, False otherwise.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      str
 |          Representation of figure as an HTML div string
 |  
 |  to_image(self, *args, **kwargs)

 |      
 |      width: int or None
 |          The width of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`
 |          property is 1.0, this will also be the width of the exported image
 |          in physical pixels.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_width`
 |      
 |      height: int or None
 |          The height of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`
 |          property is 1.0, this will also be the height of the exported image

 |      overwrite: bool
 |          If True, overwrite existing properties. If False, apply updates
 |          to existing properties recursively, preserving existing
 |          properties that are not specified in the update operation.
 |      kwargs :
 |          Keyword/value pair of properties to be updated
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      BaseFigure
 |          The Figure object that the update_layout method was called on
 |  
 |  update_traces(self, patch=None, selector=None, row=None, col=None, secondary_y=None, overwrite=False, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a property update operation on all traces that satisfy the
 |      specified selection criteria
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      patch: dict or None (default None)
 |          Dictionary of property updates to be applied to all traces that
 |          satisfy the selection criteria.
 |      selector: dict, function, int, str or None (default None)
 |          Dict to use as selection criteria.
 |          Traces will be selected if they contain properties corresponding
 |          to all of the dictionary&#39;s keys, with values that exactly match
 |          the supplied values. If None (the default), all traces are
 |          selected. If a function, it must be a function accepting a single
 |          argument and returning a boolean. The function will be called on
 |          each trace and those for which the function returned True
 |          will be in the selection. If an int N, the Nth trace matching row
 |          and col will be selected (N can be negative). If a string S, the selector
 |          is equivalent to dict(type=S).
 |      row, col: int or None (default None)
 |          Subplot row and column index of traces to select.
 |          To select traces by row and column, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots.  If None
 |          (the default), all traces are selected.
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          * If True, only select traces associated with the secondary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If False, only select traces associated with the primary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If None (the default), do not filter traces based on secondary
 |            y-axis.
 |      
 |          To select traces by secondary y-axis, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots. See the docstring
 |          for the specs argument to make_subplots for more info on
 |          creating subplots with secondary y-axes.
 |      overwrite: bool
 |          If True, overwrite existing properties. If False, apply updates
 |          to existing properties recursively, preserving existing
 |          properties that are not specified in the update operation.
 |      **kwargs
 |          Additional property updates to apply to each selected trace. If
 |          a property is specified in both patch and in **kwargs then the
 |          one in **kwargs takes precedence.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      self
 |          Returns the Figure object that the method was called on
 |  
 |  write_html(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Write a figure to an HTML file representation
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      file: str or writeable
 |          A string representing a local file path or a writeable object
 |          (e.g. a pathlib.Path object or an open file descriptor)
 |      config: dict or None (default None)
 |          Plotly.js figure config options
 |      auto_play: bool (default=True)
 |          Whether to automatically start the animation sequence on page load
 |          if the figure contains frames. Has no effect if the figure does not
 |          contain frames.
 |      include_plotlyjs: bool or string (default True)
 |          Specifies how the plotly.js library is included/loaded in the output
 |          div string.
 |      
 |          If True, a script tag containing the plotly.js source code (~3MB)
 |          is included in the output.  HTML files generated with this option are
 |          fully self-contained and can be used offline.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references the plotly.js CDN is included
 |          in the output. HTML files generated with this option are about 3MB
 |          smaller than those generated with include_plotlyjs=True, but they
 |          require an active internet connection in order to load the plotly.js
 |          library.
 |      
 |          If &#39;directory&#39;, a script tag is included that references an external
 |          plotly.min.js bundle that is assumed to reside in the same
 |          directory as the HTML file. If `file` is a string to a local file path
 |          and `full_html` is True then
 |      
 |          If &#39;directory&#39;, a script tag is included that references an external
 |          plotly.min.js bundle that is assumed to reside in the same
 |          directory as the HTML file.  If `file` is a string to a local file
 |          path and `full_html` is True, then the plotly.min.js bundle is copied
 |          into the directory of the resulting HTML file. If a file named
 |          plotly.min.js already exists in the output directory then this file
 |          is left unmodified and no copy is performed. HTML files generated
 |          with this option can be used offline, but they require a copy of
 |          the plotly.min.js bundle in the same directory. This option is
 |          useful when many figures will be saved as HTML files in the same
 |          directory because the plotly.js source code will be included only
 |          once per output directory, rather than once per output file.
 |      
 |          If &#39;require&#39;, Plotly.js is loaded using require.js.  This option
 |          assumes that require.js is globally available and that it has been
 |          globally configured to know how to find Plotly.js as &#39;plotly&#39;.
 |          This option is not advised when full_html=True as it will result
 |          in a non-functional html file.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point
 |          the resulting HTML file to an alternative CDN or local bundle.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing plotly.js is included. This is
 |          useful when the resulting div string will be placed inside an HTML
 |          document that already loads plotly.js.  This option is not advised
 |          when full_html=True as it will result in a non-functional html file.
 |      
 |      include_mathjax: bool or string (default False)
 |          Specifies how the MathJax.js library is included in the output html
 |          div string.  MathJax is required in order to display labels
 |          with LaTeX typesetting.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing MathJax.js will be included in the
 |          output.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references a MathJax CDN location will be
 |          included in the output.  HTML div strings generated with this option
 |          will be able to display LaTeX typesetting as long as internet access
 |          is available.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point the
 |          resulting HTML div string to an alternative CDN.
 |      post_script: str or list or None (default None)
 |          JavaScript snippet(s) to be included in the resulting div just after
 |          plot creation.  The string(s) may include &#39;{plot_id}&#39; placeholders
 |          that will then be replaced by the `id` of the div element that the
 |          plotly.js figure is associated with.  One application for this script
 |          is to install custom plotly.js event handlers.
 |      full_html: bool (default True)
 |          If True, produce a string containing a complete HTML document
 |          starting with an &lt;html&gt; tag.  If False, produce a string containing
 |          a single &lt;div&gt; element.
 |      animation_opts: dict or None (default None)
 |          dict of custom animation parameters to be passed to the function
 |          Plotly.animate in Plotly.js. See
 |          https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/src/plots/animation_attributes.js
 |          for available options. Has no effect if the figure does not contain
 |          frames, or auto_play is False.
 |      default_width, default_height: number or str (default &#39;100%&#39;)
 |          The default figure width/height to use if the provided figure does not
 |          specify its own layout.width/layout.height property.  May be
 |          specified in pixels as an integer (e.g. 500), or as a css width style
 |          string (e.g. &#39;500px&#39;, &#39;100%&#39;).
 |      validate: bool (default True)
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being converted to
 |          JSON, False otherwise.
 |      auto_open: bool (default True
 |          If True, open the saved file in a web browser after saving.
 |          This argument only applies if `full_html` is True.
 |      Returns
 |      -------

 |  
 |  write_image(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Convert a figure to a static image and write it to a file or writeable

 |      
 |          If not specified and `file` is a string then this will default to the
 |          file extension. If not specified and `file` is not a string then this
 |          will default to `plotly.io.config.default_format`
 |      
 |      width: int or None
 |          The width of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`

 |      scale: int or float or None
 |          The scale factor to use when exporting the figure. A scale factor
 |          larger than 1.0 will increase the image resolution with respect
 |          to the figure&#39;s layout pixel dimensions. Whereas as scale factor of
 |          less than 1.0 will decrease the image resolution.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_scale`
 |      
 |      validate: bool

 |          True if JSON representation should be pretty-printed, False if
 |          representation should be as compact as possible.
 |      
 |      remove_uids: bool (default True)
 |          True if trace UIDs should be omitted from the JSON representation
 |      
 |      engine: str (default None)
 |          The JSON encoding engine to use. One of:
 |            - &quot;json&quot; for an encoder based on the built-in Python json module

 |      names : list, str, All
 |          If names is All, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
 |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
 |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
 |      type : str, All (default: &#39;change&#39;)
 |          The type of notification to filter by. If equal to All, then all
 |          notifications are passed to the observe handler.
 |  
 |  on_trait_change(self, handler=None, name=None, remove=False)
 |      DEPRECATED: Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
 |      
 |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
 |      
 |      Static handlers can be created by creating methods on a HasTraits
 |      subclass with the naming convention &#39;_[traitname]_changed&#39;.  Thus,
 |      to create static handler for the trait &#39;a&#39;, create the method
 |      _a_changed(self, name, old, new) (fewer arguments can be used, see
 |      below).
 |      
 |      If `remove` is True and `handler` is not specified, all change
 |      handlers for the specified name are uninstalled.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable, None
 |          A callable that is called when a trait changes.  Its
 |          signature can be handler(), handler(name), handler(name, new),
 |          handler(name, old, new), or handler(name, old, new, self).
 |      name : list, str, None
 |          If None, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
 |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
 |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
 |      remove : bool
 |          If False (the default), then install the handler.  If True
 |          then unintall it.
 |  
 |  set_trait(self, name, value)
 |      Forcibly sets trait attribute, including read-only attributes.
 |  
 |  setup_instance(*args, **kwargs)
 |      This is called **before** self.__init__ is called.
 |  
 |  trait_defaults(self, *names, **metadata)
 |      Return a trait&#39;s default value or a dictionary of them
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Dynamically generated default values may
 |      depend on the current state of the object.
 |  
 |  trait_has_value(self, name)
 |      Returns True if the specified trait has a value.
 |      
 |      This will return false even if ``getattr`` would return a
 |      dynamically generated default value. These default values
 |      will be recognized as existing only after they have been
 |      generated.
 |      
 |      Example
 |      
 |      .. code-block:: python
 |      
 |          class MyClass(HasTraits):
 |              i = Int()
 |      
 |          mc = MyClass()
 |          assert not mc.trait_has_value(&quot;i&quot;)
 |          mc.i # generates a default value
 |          assert mc.trait_has_value(&quot;i&quot;)
 |  
 |  trait_metadata(self, traitname, key, default=None)
 |      Get metadata values for trait by key.
 |  
 |  trait_names(self, **metadata)
 |      Get a list of all the names of this class&#39; traits.
 |  
 |  trait_values(self, **metadata)
 |      A ``dict`` of trait names and their values.
 |      
 |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
 |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
 |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
 |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
 |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn&#39;t exist, None will be passed
 |      to the function.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      A ``dict`` of trait names and their values.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Trait values are retrieved via ``getattr``, any exceptions raised
 |      by traits or the operations they may trigger will result in the
 |      absence of a trait value in the result ``dict``.
 |  
 |  traits(self, **metadata)
 |      Get a ``dict`` of all the traits of this class.  The dictionary
 |      is keyed on the name and the values are the TraitType objects.
 |      
 |      The TraitTypes returned don&#39;t know anything about the values
 |      that the various HasTrait&#39;s instances are holding.
 |      
 |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
 |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
 |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
 |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
 |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn&#39;t exist, None will be passed
 |      to the function.
 |  
 |  unobserve(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type=&#39;change&#39;)
 |      Remove a trait change handler.
 |      
 |      This is used to unregister handlers to trait change notifications.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      handler : callable
 |          The callable called when a trait attribute changes.
 |      names : list, str, All (default: All)
 |          The names of the traits for which the specified handler should be
 |          uninstalled. If names is All, the specified handler is uninstalled
 |          from the list of notifiers corresponding to all changes.
 |      type : str or All (default: &#39;change&#39;)
 |          The type of notification to filter by. If All, the specified handler
 |          is uninstalled from the list of notifiers corresponding to all types.
 |  
 |  unobserve_all(self, name=traitlets.All)
 |      Remove trait change handlers of any type for the specified name.
 |      If name is not specified, removes all trait notifiers.
